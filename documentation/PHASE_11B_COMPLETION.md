## Known Limitations & Deferred Work

### Out of Scope for Phase 11B:
1. **Facebook Scraper (fb.py)**
   - Larger codebase requiring more careful refactoring
   - Deferred to Phase 12B
   - Contains specialized authentication logic

2. **Scrapy Integration (scraper.py)**
   - EventSpider class uses Scrapy framework
   - Requires different architectural pattern
   - Deferred to Phase 12A

3. **Schema-Related Tests**
   - Failing schema tests identified in Phase 10
   - Not in scope for Phase 11B
   - Deferred to Phase 12+

---

## Recommendations for Next Phase

### Phase 12A: Scrapy Framework Integration
- Refactor EventSpider in scraper.py
- Integrate with BaseScraper patterns where applicable
- Maintain Scrapy-specific patterns where needed
- Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

### Phase 12B: Facebook Scraper Improvements
- Refactor FacebookScraper in fb.py
- This is the largest scraper (~600+ lines)
- Requires careful handling of FB-specific patterns
- Estimated effort: 6-8 hours

### Phase 12C: Additional Scraper Tests
- Create comprehensive tests for V2 scrapers
- Integration tests across multiple scrapers
- End-to-end testing scenarios
- Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

### Phase 13: Performance & Documentation
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Final documentation updates
- Benchmarking before/after refactoring
- Cleanup of deprecated code
- Estimated effort: 3-4 hours

## Conclusion

Phase 11B successfully completed all planned refactoring work for ReadExtract and EventbriteScraper. Both scrapers now leverage the BaseScraper abstract class and 7 utility modules created in Phase 11A, resulting in significant code reduction, improved maintainability, and better error handling.

The refactoring maintains 100% backward compatibility with existing code while providing a clear path for gradual migration to the new architecture. Future scrapers (fb.py, scraper.py) can follow the same pattern established in this phase.

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR NEXT PHASE
