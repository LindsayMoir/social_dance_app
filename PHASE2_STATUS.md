## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Summary

Phase 2 focuses on architecture refactoring by extracting the AddressRepository from DatabaseHandler. This addresses the most critical code duplication (address resolution logic scattered in 5+ places).

### What's Been Accomplished

- âœ… Created AddressRepository class (470+ lines)
- âœ… Extracted 10+ address-related methods from DatabaseHandler
- âœ… Implemented multi-strategy address matching (postal, street, city, building)
- âœ… Created 22 comprehensive unit tests (all passing)
- âœ… 100% backward compatible (no modifications to db.py)
- âœ… 1 commit pushed to phase2 branch

### Current State

- **42 total unit tests passing** (22 new + 20 from Phase 1)
- **AddressRepository ready for integration** into DatabaseHandler
- **No breaking changes** - all new code, no modifications to existing
- **Repository pattern established** for future extraction phases

## ðŸ“¦ Phase 2 Deliverables

### New Files Created

```
src/repositories/__init__.py                      (8 lines)      âœ… DONE
src/repositories/address_repository.py            (470+ lines)   âœ… DONE
tests/unit/test_address_repository.py             (280+ lines)   âœ… DONE
```

### Methods Extracted to AddressRepository

1. **resolve_or_insert_address()** (200 lines)
   - Multi-strategy address matching in order of specificity
   - Postal code + street number match (highest specificity)
   - Street number + street name match
   - City + building name fuzzy match
   - Building name-only fuzzy match (lowest specificity)
   - Automatic insertion with deduplication checks
   - Uses FuzzyMatcher for consistent fuzzy scoring

2. **build_full_address()** (60 lines)
   - Standardized address formatting
   - Handles all address components (building, street, city, province, postal, country)
   - Gracefully omits missing components

3. **get_full_address_from_id()** (10 lines)
   - Simple lookup of full_address by address_id

4. **find_address_by_building_name()** (50 lines)
   - Fuzzy matching on building names
   - Prevents duplicate venue creation
   - Configurable similarity threshold

5. **quick_address_lookup()** (100 lines)
   - Three-tier lookup strategy without LLM
   - Exact match on full_address
   - Regex parsing + exact street match
   - Fuzzy building name matching on same street

6. **format_address_from_db_row()** (50 lines)
   - Format address from postal database row
   - Used for address validation and formatting

### Test Coverage

**22 Unit Tests - All Passing**

Test categories:
- Initialization (1 test)
- Address building (3 tests)
- Address lookup (4 tests)
- Building name matching (6 tests)
- Database row formatting (3 tests)
- Address resolution (4 tests)
- Exception handling (1 test)

Edge cases covered:
- None/empty inputs
- Missing address components
- Fuzzy matching with varying thresholds
- Database query failures
- Malformed data

## ðŸŽ“ AddressRepository Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.repositories.address_repository import AddressRepository

# Initialize with database handler
address_repo = AddressRepository(db_handler)

# Resolve or insert address
parsed_address = {
    "building_name": "Duke Saloon",
    "street_number": "123",
    "street_name": "Main",
    "city": "Toronto",
    "province_or_state": "ON",
    "postal_code": "M5V 3A8",
    "country_id": "CA"
}

address_id = address_repo.resolve_or_insert_address(parsed_address)
print(f"Address ID: {address_id}")
```

### Building Full Address

```python
full_address = address_repo.build_full_address(
    building_name="Duke Saloon",
    street_number="123",
    street_name="Main",
    street_type="St",
    city="Toronto",
    province_or_state="ON",
    postal_code="M5V 3A8",
    country_id="CA"
)
# Returns: "Duke Saloon, 123 Main St, Toronto, ON M5V 3A8, CA"
```

### Quick Address Lookup

```python
# Without LLM cost
address_id = address_repo.quick_address_lookup("123 Main St, Toronto")
if address_id:
    print(f"Found address: {address_id}")
else:
    # Fall back to LLM parsing if needed
    pass
```

### Finding by Building Name

```python
# Fuzzy match on venue name
address_id = address_repo.find_address_by_building_name(
    "The Duke Saloon",  # User input
    threshold=80  # Match quality (0-100)
)
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate (If Continuing Phase 2)

The AddressRepository is now ready for integration into DatabaseHandler:

1. **Test Integration in db.py**
   ```python
   from repositories.address_repository import AddressRepository

   # In DatabaseHandler.__init__()
   self.address_repo = AddressRepository(self)

   # Replace existing calls with:
   # OLD: self.resolve_or_insert_address(parsed_address)
   # NEW: self.address_repo.resolve_or_insert_address(parsed_address)
   ```

2. **Update DatabaseHandler Methods**
   - Create wrapper methods that delegate to AddressRepository
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
   - Remove extracted methods from db.py (after integration verified)

3. **Verify Backward Compatibility**
   - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
   - Test all code paths that use address methods

### Phase 2 Remaining Work (Not Started)

Per the comprehensive code review, Phase 2 should also include:

- **URLRepository Extraction** (100+ lines from db.py)
  - URL validation and storage
  - Blacklist management
  - URL deduplication

- **EventRepository Extraction** (200+ lines from db.py)
  - Event CRUD operations
  - Event deduplication
  - Event validation

Each can follow the same pattern as AddressRepository.

### Phase 3 and Beyond

- Refactor LLM integration (provider abstraction pattern)
- Implement dependency injection pattern
- Add comprehensive integration tests
- Performance optimization
- Full architecture documentation

## ðŸ’¡ Key Design Decisions

### Why Repository Pattern?

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Address logic isolated from database handler
2. **Reusability** - Can be used by other services without importing entire db.py
3. **Testability** - Easy to mock and unit test in isolation
4. **Maintainability** - Related methods grouped together
5. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new address resolution strategies

### Why Multi-Strategy Matching?

Address matching in real world is complex:
- Different data sources have different quality levels
- User input variations (typos, abbreviations, etc.)
- Multiple strategies allow graceful degradation
- Fuzzy matching prevents false positives while still catching variations

### Why FuzzyMatcher?

- Centralized fuzzy logic (from Phase 1)
- Consistent scoring across all strategies
- Easy to tune thresholds in one place
- Supports multiple algorithms (token_set, partial, ratio)

## ðŸ”§ How to Continue

### If Continuing Phase 2 Integration

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on the phase2 branch
git checkout refactor/code-cleanup-phase2

# 2. Verify tests pass
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# 3. Start integrating AddressRepository into db.py
# - Create wrapper methods in DatabaseHandler
# - Update all callers to use address_repo methods
# - Keep existing methods as delegation wrappers
# - Run tests after each change

# 4. Commit when complete
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: Integrate AddressRepository into DatabaseHandler"

# 5. Push to remote
git push origin refactor/code-cleanup-phase2
```

### If Starting Fresh (Next Session)

```bash
# 1. Read this document (5 min)
# 2. Check branch status
git log --oneline -5
git branch -v

# 3. Run tests to verify everything works
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# 4. Review AddressRepository implementation
code src/repositories/address_repository.py

# 5. Begin integration or move to next repository (URLRepository)
```

**Status:** Phase 2 AddressRepository extraction complete and ready for integration or next steps.

**Next Decision:** Integrate AddressRepository into db.py, or proceed with URLRepository extraction?
