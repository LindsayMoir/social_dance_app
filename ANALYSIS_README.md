## Key Findings

### Current Problems

1. **Single Responsibility Violations** (15+ concerns)
   - LLM operations mixed with database operations
   - Caching logic spread across methods
   - Data transformation intertwined with address resolution
   - Admin operations mixed with operational code

2. **High Complexity**
   - process_event_address() at 160 lines
   - Cyclomatic complexity estimated >50
   - Multiple nested conditionals and fallback paths

3. **Poor Testability**
   - Large methods hard to unit test
   - Many dependencies to mock
   - Edge cases difficult to cover

4. **Circular Dependencies**
   - DatabaseHandler creates LLMHandler
   - LLMHandler creates DatabaseHandler
   - Requires set_llm_handler() injection workaround

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Extract 5 New Repositories**
   - AddressResolutionRepository (LLM operations)
   - LocationCacheRepository (Caching)
   - AddressDataRepository (Data transformation)
   - Enhanced EventManagementRepository (Quality)
   - DatabaseMaintenanceRepository (Admin)

2. **Reduce Size by 48%**
   - From 2,249 to ~1,169 lines
   - Extract 22 methods
   - Remove ~300 lines of wrappers

3. **Improve SOLID Compliance**
   - Single Responsibility: Clear boundaries
   - Open/Closed: Extensible without modification
   - Dependency Inversion: Through interfaces
   - High Cohesion: Focused repositories

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: CRITICAL (2-3 days)
```
├─ AddressResolutionRepository (220 lines)
├─ LocationCacheRepository (110 lines)
└─ AddressDataRepository (180 lines)
```

### Phase 2: HIGH (2-3 days)
```
└─ Enhanced EventManagementRepository (250 lines)
```

### Phase 3: MEDIUM (2-3 days)
```
└─ DatabaseMaintenanceRepository (320 lines)
```

### Phase 4: POLISH (1 day)
```
└─ Utility method relocations (150 lines)
```

**Total Estimated Effort:** 7-10 days (including thorough testing)

## Questions & Discussion Points

### For Team Discussion
1. Extraction order - start with Group 2 or Group 5?
2. LLM handler optional parameter vs separate implementation?
3. Caching strategy - in-memory only or with TTL?
4. Timeline - aggressive (4-5 days) or conservative (2 weeks)?

### For Code Review
1. Are dependencies clear and well-injected?
2. Is test coverage sufficient (>80%)?
3. Any performance regressions?
4. Documentation complete?

### For Monitoring Post-Deployment
1. Cache hit rates (LocationCacheRepository)
2. LLM query latencies (AddressResolutionRepository)
3. Error rates by repository
4. Database query performance
