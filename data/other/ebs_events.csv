Live music, immersive energy, and audience-in-the-room intensity. Step inside Desde Adentro — a contemporary tango-theatre performance blending live musicians, original choreography, and an atmosphere that feels like a night in Buenos Aires, reimagined in Vancouver. Raw, cinematic, and avant-garde. Directed and choreographed by Albano Goldenberg , a renowned maestro from Buenos Aires, together with an ensemble of Vancouver-based dancers and musicians, Desde Adentro invites you to experience tango from the inside out — the tension, the tenderness, the pulse. Expect contemporary staging, intimate proximity, and moments of audience participation that make the room part of the story. 🎟 Tickets are available exclusively via Showpass → https://www.showpass.com/desde-adentro/ Choose your showtime: 6:00 PM or 8:30 PM. Your ticket also includes entry to a social tango Milonga at 9:45 PM — the traditional gathering where tango is danced socially. If you attend the 8:30 PM show , simply stay after the performance. If you attend the 6:00 PM show , return at 9:45 PM to join the milonga!
