Program TBA Canadian born violinist, Kai Gleusteen started at the age of five years old in his native city, Calgary. Already at a young age, he had the opportunity to study with the most renowned violinists and teachers of his time, including Nathan Milstein, Ivan Galamian, Josef Gingold, Dorothy Delay, and Zakhar Bron. By the age of seventeen, Kai was awarded the top prize in the Commonwealth Concerto Competition in Australia, he had received the prestigious Skene Award in Scotland and had formed his first chamber orchestra: The Group of Twelve. A strong believer in the musician as a multi-dimensional human being, Kai chose to combine his musical studies with academic pursuits. At the University of Michigan, he studied anthropology, geophysics, and philosophy. He received a Master's Degree from Rice University under the tutelage of the violinist Camilla Wicks. In 1991, Kai moved to Europe. Paris and Prague were his bases for nine years, allowing him to develop and perform both as a soloist and concertmaster. In the year 2000, he won the concertmaster position of the Orchestra 'del Gran Teatre del Liceu' and subsequently moved to Barcelona. Since 2003, he was appointed professor at the Escuela Superior de Musica de Catalunya and founded the chamber music series called Kaimerata Concerts. He continues to perform extensively as a soloist and a recitalist and has released numerous critically acclaimed recordings. Although Catherine Ordronneau performed her first solo concert at age 12, it is only when she turned 18 that she decided to devote herself entirely to music, receiving guidance from French pianist François-Rene Duchable and the pedagogue Monique Deschaussees, herself a student of the great Alfred Cortot. After receiving the highest distinction in academics, and the prize of the Foundation Lefebure, she chose to avoid international competitions in order to develop and grow as a well-rounded musician. Catherine performs extensively in North America, Europe and China. She was invited to play as a soloist with the various orchestras throughout North America, Europe and the Middle East. Since 2008, she regularly goes to China and has played in the most prestigious halls, including the Oriental Art Center in Shanghai and the Performing Arts Center in Tianjin. She recorded live for CBC Radio, Bravo, TV2 in Spain, Radio France. Catherine has a great passion for chamber music and has taken part in many international chamber music festivals. She has worked and performed with her partner Kai Gleusteen for more than 20 years and their discography includes award winning recordings. Catherine is professor of piano and chamber music in the Liceu Conservatorio Superior de Musica in Barcelona.",CA$25 – CA$45,"1156 Fort, Victoria, BC V8V 3K8, CA",https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/kai-gleusteen-violin-and-catherine-ordronneau-piano-tickets-1374961339379?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,Eventbrite,2026-01-03 18:27:19.358301

Alpha Yaya Diallo & Friends,2026-02-20,2026-02-20,19:30:00,22:00:00,Friday,concert,,"JUNO Award winning guitarist and singer Alpha Yaya Diallo, from Guinea in West Africa, is one of the hottest acts on the current world music scene. Now based in Vancouver, Canada, he’s earned a matchless reputation internationally for the excellence of his musicianship and the excitement of his live shows. Diallo is a uniquely multi-talented artist. His dexterous acoustic and electric guitar-playing, with its fluid melodic lines and compelling grooves, places him in the front ranks of African axemen. In addition, he is a skilled and experienced performer on a variety of percussion instruments, and on the balafon (traditional wooden xylphone). To complete the abundance of riches Diallo writes his own compositions, and sings with a supple and beautifully modulated voice. By successfully uniting the traditional and the contemporary, Diallo has carved a niche for himself beside such West African luminaries as Salif Keita, Baaba Maal, Youssou N’Dour, and Ismael Lo. Always seeking new territories to explore while at the same time respecting his roots, Alpha Yaya Diallo is one of the most inspired and inspirational world music artists performing anywhere, this is guaranteed to be an incredible evening of world music you don't want to miss! For this special show Alpha will be joined by his talented musical friends, Etienne Mangala on bass, Knowledge Majoni on drums, Aboubacar Kone on keyboards and percussion and Hassanatou Camara back up vocals and dancing!!!

""The easiest, and yet most compelling dance class I've ever been to in my life."" — Nancy, 2017 ""It's out of the head, and into more of a movement or a flow."" — Nathan, 2015 “I appreciate your ability to connect dancers both on and off the dance floor. You create an environment that is relaxed and inviting [and] I’ve easily connected with others at your classes Thank you for facilitating connection on all levels!” — Traci, 2013 FAQs What should I wear? Comfortable clothing or dress it up. The important thing is shoes: wear shoes that allow you to pivot/spin (i.e., do not grip the floor), that are secure on your feet (i.e., no flip-flops), and that you can walk comfortably in. If in doubt, feel free to bring an extra pair with you. You can also turn almost any comfortable shoe into a dance shoe by placing an old sock over the front half of the shoe. This should allow you to pivot easily. Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No need to print your ticket; once you register you'll be on the list! What is the refund policy? No refunds. However, the class slot is transferrable to someone who will dance the same role (follow or lead) as the original registration.

"Ana Popovic - Dance To The Rhythm Tour with guest, Paul Pigat",2026-01-16,2026-01-16,19:00:00,21:00:00,Friday,concert,,"Legendary Blues guitarist Ana Popovic brings her 'Dance to the Rhythm' tour to the Rickshaw! The Rickshaw presents Ana Popovic - Dance To The Rhythm Tour With guest, Paul Pigat (Solo) January 16th, 2025 The Rickshaw Theatre 19+ Doors: 7:00pm Show: 8:00pm Ana Popovic Los Angeles-based and critically acclaimed guitarist and singer Ana Popovic is set to release her highly anticipated album Dance To The Rhythm (Electric Heel Records) on September 26, 2025. Produced by Popovic and Buthel, the album showcases a groundbreaking fusion of groove, blues, funk, and soul. Building on the success of her previous work, Dance To The Rhythm pushes boundaries, seamlessly blending infectious dance grooves (“Dance To The Rhythm” / “Sho Nuff”) with raw blues guitar and powerful lyrics. From the soulful 'Soul’ution' to the funky 'Hottest Ticket In Town' and the bluesy 'Dwell On The Feeling', 'California Chase,' the album weaves a rich tapestry of musical styles, reflecting Popovic's masterful versatility. The track 'Sisters and Brothers' channels a Steely Dan-like arrangement, while 'Hurt So Good' brings a contemporary mainstream flair. The ultimate jam comes in the form of a clever reimagining of Paul Simon’s '50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.' Ana says: 'One of my biggest strengths on stage is my ability to make people dance. Music should take you to a place where you can let go, feel the groove, and move. You want music to grab you, to have a pocket that you can’t resist. —everything else revolves around it. Blues guitar has never really been part of dance music before, and in that way, it’s revolutionary. Guitar plays a central role in these tracks, breaking down the boundaries created by time, culture, and musical traditions. With this album, I’m pushing those boundaries.' For Ana, blues guitar is the foundation of everything in her music. Yet, she masterfully blends genres, effortlessly shifting from blues to dance, jam band, funk, pop, and even gospel—it's all part of her evolving sound. A true pioneer, Ana combines her blues guitar roots with bold experimentation, redefining the intersection of blues and dance music. Her live performances, whether with her six-piece or eleven-piece funk band FUNTASTAFUNK, are electrifying, blending fierce guitar work with irresistible rhythms that compel audiences to move. A multi-award-winning artist, Popovic has earned recognition from major outlets and industry figures, including Bruce Springsteen, who called her 'one helluva guitar player.' She’s been nominated for seven Blues Music Awards, and her latest album POWER hit #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart. Ana has shared stages with legends such as B.B. King, Joe Bonamassa, Warren Haynes, Robert Plant, and Gary Clark Jr., and is an endorsee of Fender, D'Angelico, Jim Dunlop, and DR Strings. Popovic's commitment to her craft and fearless boundary-pushing ensures she remains one of the most dynamic forces in contemporary blues and beyond. anapopovic.com Paul Pigat You’d never think it to look at Paul Pigat, but behind that unassuming grin and underneath those Doc Watson glasses lurks one of the most restless, combustible musical imaginations ever crammed like so much canned heat into a single body. Blessed with a jazz man’s sheen, a rockabilly heart and a hobo’s soul, there aren’t many genres of music that don’t pull at Pigat’s wayfaring imagination like a magnet. In many ways, it’s a mystery why Paul Pigat isn’t a household name yet. Maybe he’d be a lot easier to pin down if he wasn’t so darn good at so many different things. paulpigat.com RSVP on Facebook Refund Policy No refunds, unless event is cancelled. No exchanges.
