Step into the ancient tale of Vasilisa, who journeyed into the forest to face the fierce Baba Yaga and returned with fire that burns away what is false and illuminates what is true. Together we will: Listen to the live storytelling Sit in the woods with the dark and return with light Share wisdom, reflection, and firelit nourishment Embroider white linen with red thread, weaving soul into form This is a retreat of grief, beauty, and initiation. For women who hold space that are ready to be held in the dark, reclaim the spark, and stitch it into their lives. Because even leaders need to lay it down sometimes. Even fire-keepers need to sit in the dark. Salt Spring Island · Nov 8–9 (overnight retreat) Calls: Monday evenings Nov 3 & Nov 17 inquire: ignite@naomijason.com early bird: $495 (till Oct 15) full: $595 Included: overnight sleepover optional (bring your own bedding) *upgrade to private room upon request ****** Step into the dark woods. Return with your flame. ****** There is a time when every woman is asked to walk into the unknown, to face the dark woods and the fierce questions that live there. In the old Slavic tale of Vasilisa the Beautiful, a young girl is sent into the forest to seek fire from Baba Yaga. What begins as exile becomes initiation: through tasks of patience, courage, and devotion, she returns with the fire of truth—the flame that burns away illusion and lights the way forward. This retreat is our own journey into the dark woods. Before we gather, we meet in a live storytelling call, listening to Vasilisa’s tale and naming the intentions we will carry. At retreat, we open ceremonial space, nourish our bodies, and step into the night woods to sit in silence with the unseen. From darkness we return to the fire, each woman lighting her own candle, a symbol of the spark carried home. The next morning we move and dance our bodies alive, then enter sacred craft—embroidering white linen with red thread, just as Vasalisa wove beauty from her fire. Each stitch a prayer. Each thread a continuation of the story. Afterward, we return once more in a post-retreat integration call, tending the embers and grounding the fire into our daily lives. This is a circle for women who are ready to: Sit with grief, shadow, and mystery Reclaim the fire of their own soul Weave the light into body, home, and community",CA$529.47,"1361 Beaver Point, Salt Spring Island, BC V8K 1W9, CA",https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/into-the-dark-woods-a-rite-of-passage-tickets-1772701791779?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,Eventbrite,2025-10-24 10:11:16.880342

Information below. “The beloved ensemble that is tango and beyond. It is world. It is classical. It is jazz. It is tango…a delicious swirl of music that is the Payadora Ensemble.” – Classical 96.3 FM Award-winning Canadian chamber music ensemble Payadora performs original compositions and arrangements drawing from Argentinian/Uruguayan tango and folk music. These musical powerhouses have combined tango with their classical, jazz and world music backgrounds to create something entirely new. Payadora draws from the height of Buenos Aires’ tango tradition, including compositions by De Caro, Pugliese, Troilo, and Salgan, and the masterful, contemporary sounds of Astor Piazzolla and beyond. Officially endorsed by the Argentinian Consulate in Toronto for its adherence to the spirit of tango, Payadora’s performances convey joy, virtuosity, humour, and intense passion. Payadora has presented concerts and sold-out shows around the world. They have collaborated with the London Symphonia, the Cathedral Bluffs Symphony, the Hannaford Street Silver Band, and the PointeTango Dance Company. Their critically-acclaimed album Silent Tears: The Last Yiddish Tango won the 2024 Folk Music Ontario Award and reached #1 on the World Music Charts in Europe. They have been named on “Best of” lists on NPR’s Rhythm Atlas, Finnish National Radio and CBC Classical. Payadora were also nominated for the Folk Music Awards as “Best Performing Artists.” They released Legend of Carau in 2025, based on the Argentinian folk tale. Now, they return to Victoria after their last appearance at the 2022 World Accordion and Tango Festival! This stellar lineup features some of the most respected chamber musicians in Canada: Rebekah Wolkstein violin/vocals , Drew Jurecka bandoneon/violin/mandolin , Joseph Phillips bass/guitar , and Clark Schaufele piano .
