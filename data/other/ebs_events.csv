Scott Lambridis- St. Ulphia's Dead,2026-07-25,2026-07-25,16:00:00,17:00:00,Saturday,other,,"Join us for a lively panel discussion about how humor and absurdity illuminate our darkest themes, and to celebrate Lambridis's debut novel! A lively, craft-minded panel discussion about how humor and absurdity illuminate our darkest themes. To celebrate the launch of his debut novel, Scott Lambridis joins fellow Bellingham writers David Beaumier, Brittany Micka-Foos, and others from HamLit, in conversation. Together they’ll explore why laughter and lightness belong beside grief and gravity, share brief readings, and invite audience questions. Part craft talk, part celebration of local storytelling, this event promises an evening that’s both thought-provoking and entertaining! St. Ulphia’s Dead is a darkly comic literary novel that follows two disgraced medical researchers investigating mass psychosis and a series of disappearances on a remote island. As the missing begin to reappear, the boundaries between fact and folklore collapse, and the researchers must confront the island’s mysteries, and their own buried truths. Scott Lambridis is a Bellingham-based writer and neurobiology lover whose fiction explores the strange edges of perception, time, and consciousness. His work has appeared in Slice, Fence, and The Café Irreal, and he earned his MFA from San Francisco State University. He once ran an indie press, toured with a progressive rock band, tended an olive farm, read a book from every country of the world, and wrote his debut novel during his daughter’s naps in France. David Beaumier is the youngest recipient of the Village Books Literary Citizenship Award. They have worked in the publishing industry and been a member of the Bellingham writing community for the last twelve years, including as the Assistant Publishing Director at Village Books. They currently help market indie authors and small presses with Chanticleer Book Reviews. When not writing, David teaches Argentine tango locally. Brittany Micka-Foos is the author of the chapbook a litany of words as fragile as window glass (Bottlecap Press, 2024). Her short stories, essays, and poetry have appeared in Ninth Letter, Witness, Literary Mama, Identity Theory, NonBinary Review, CALYX Journal, Briar Cliff Review, and elsewhere.
