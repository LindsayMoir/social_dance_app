Once I've returned from my treatment then I'll be back to teaching and will be available for private lessons - Dance lessons $55 / hour or $75 for 90 mins (can be up to four participants at one session), and DJ services. For handyman services (specializing in interior painting projects) I have a partner so please don't hesitate to reach out if you are interested in having any work done.
