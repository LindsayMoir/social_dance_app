4032,SwingSoul Vancouver Dance Is Dance Workshop - Special for Pride Weekend ,"dance, swing, wcs, west coast swing","In the spirit of PRIDE Season, we are excited to offer a special inclusive Beginner Bootcamp hosted by Dalynne! This workshop is perfect for exposing your Westie-curious friends to the dance. And if you haven't tried swapping roles, why not try something new, or refresh your favourite dance moves with an Intro to West Coast Swing crash course? West Coast Swing is special in that we do not use traditional male or female roles to dance. In fact, this dance has genderless roles, meaning that anyone can learn how to lead or follow, and many people learn how to do both! Dancing is a way for us to express ourselves, and we encourage everyone to dance in whichever way they prefer! Whether you are dancing as a leader or a follower, you don't need to be amazing in order to enjoy yourself, you just need to learn a few essential skills and the rules of the game to have fun. We'll teach you everything you need to get your groove on to any song, with any partner! Details: August 3 at Dance Vancouver Studio 4:30-6:30 pm Super fun crash course taught by our Swing Literacy instructors 7-8 pm Open WCS class: Get the Funk Out! 8-11 pm WCS dance party - everyone welcome ($15 general admission to the party, workshop attendees attend the party for free!)

NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both.

4515,Dance Temple w/ Shauna Devlin,dance,"Welcome to Dance Temple! Conscious dance and community connection in sacred space. Join us at Edelweiss Club for an ecstatic dance journey ~ Sunday, August 3rd features Shauna Devlin as our facilitator/dj. Details for Sunday, August 3rd: Facilitation and music set by Shauna Devlin. Doors open at 10:45am. Dance from 11am to 12:30pm (guided opening at 11). Sliding scale: $20-$40 (no charge for kids under 12); $15-$20 low income. Cash at the door or reserve your place with an etransfer to dancetempleinfo@gmail.com. Dance Temple is a weekly Sunday offering. Newcomers welcome! No experience necessary. Please attend only if you feel 100% well. Regular Temple Guidelines (please read through, especially if you're new to Dance Temple): **SHIRTS ON PLEASE** Please keep your shirt on, regardless of your gender (we've decided out of fairness to ask everyone, regardless of gender, to keep their shirts on). ** IF YOU INTEND TO SWEAT ** Please care for yourself and others by: 1) Taking a shower before you arrive 2) Bringing a towel to wipe up any wake you leave behind **SCENT-FREE SPACE** Please refrain from wearing anything scented in the space (including essential oils, lotions or liniments). ** CELL PHONE USE ** By popular request we have a 'no cell phone use' policy in the dance space. Please silence your phone or turn it off altogether. No cameras in the space either! If you need to use your device, please do so in the foyer or outside. As you can imagine, it's distracting otherwise. ** DANCING & CONSENT ** Enjoy your own personal dance or spark up creative movement with others, if there is mutual agreement . If you wish to dance with another, look for eye contact or the body language of an invitation (if that isn't there then it's a 'no'). Remember that a person's willingness to dance can change from moment to moment or week to week. At any time you, or the person you are dancing with, may choose to end the encounter by moving away, or bowing with hands in prayer. ** TALKING ** The dance space is a no-talking zone. This is again done to remove any distractions and to allow for dropping in more fully. If you need to have a conversation, however brief, please step out into the foyer or go outside. If you witness a conversation happening, you are welcome to gently remind people of this request (with a gesture). ** KIDS ** Parents are asked to kindly monitor their kids and keep them close. Please do not permit your kids to run freely through the dance space - this is risky for kids and for dancers. If it's quiet (especially at the beginning and ending), and your kids aren't - please see that they are guided into relative silence. Otherwise we will ask you to take them outside so as not to distract others from the proceedings. **FOOTWEAR** Please wear socks or indoor shoes/sneakers in the dance space. HERE'S MORE OF WHAT DANCE TEMPLE OFFERS: • Practice freedom of expression through movement, while respecting and being aware of those around you. • Tune into an eclectic selection of musical flavors from a revolving lineup of experienced facilitators. • Inspire and explore new ways to move your body. • Explore the altar space for contemplation, reflection and intention setting. • Learn to enter into a state of trance without the use of substances (no drugs or alcohol please). • Non denominational opening and closing (can be in the form of an embodiment practice, prayer or meditation) • Minimal facilitation. You are free to move as you wish. Dance Temple is an inclusive community that celebrates gender diversity and authentic expression. In Closing: Please arrive early or on time so that we may all journey together. Bring a water bottle. Breathe. Take care of yourself, others and the space. Wear comfortable clothing for movement. Be prepared to sweat. We acknowledge with deep respect and gratitude that we gather on unceded Lekwungen Territory, home of the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations. We honour the long-time, ongoing indigenous stewardship of this land.",Sunday,2025-08-03,2025-08-03,11:00:00,12:30:00,extracted_text,"Edelweiss Club, 108 Niagra Street, Victoria, BC V8V 1E9, CA",$20-$40 (no charge for kids under 12); $15-$20 low income,https://www.facebook.com/events/1446877326461057/,class,1,2025-08-02 10:29:15.541154,0.0,social dance

NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.
