1528,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha- Beginner Intermediate,"cha cha, cha cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is dancers that have completed the Fundamentals course and want to continue to improve their social dancing using the techniques they have learned. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 9:00- 10:00pm No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Must have completed Fundamentals or have instructor permission to attend.
