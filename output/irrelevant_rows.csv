2995,Texture Your Moves for West Coast Swing,"swing, wcs, west coast swing","We will guide you through practical musicality and movement drills that will 'colour in' any pattern in your repertoire. You'll learn: +++ How you can do more styling without feeling inhibited OR being reckless. +++ How to preserve your partnership connection while still expressing yourself. +++ How to enjoy being musical even with partners who are missing skills. +++ How to respect the rules of the WCS while learning to bend them. Come learn a super practical & universal way to LEVEL UP your musicality by adding body pulse & groove to add more personality and creativity into basic patterns, then get lots of reps to practice these tactics with the appropriate connection and timing. All the while putting these skills to use immediately in your social dancing! In this workshop we are going to take your Feetwork, Bodywork and Grooves you might ALREADY know.. with your common WCS patterns. We will show you ways to texture a  Tandem Slingshot, Hustle Check, Over Rotated Under Arm Turn. Leg Sweep to a Lunge. Do you have a style you just don't like? eg. Honky Tonk blues or lyrical or 12/8 songs. Or how about Rap sections of the song or when the song goes half the speed. Or how about those pesky bastard phrases. This workshop is for you if; You have no idea how to dance differently to different genres of music, so most of your dances look or feel the same. You feel like you are just walking through patterns without any real character to your movement and you feel robotic and stiff. You can do body pulse and contra-body but they are not automatic in your dancing yet. You can't seem to make wise, deliberate choices for texturing your moves to the music. You aren’t able to make your slow tempo songs look distinct from your other genres.",Saturday,2025-07-15,2025-07-15,11:00:00,13:00:00,Victoria West Coast Swing Dancing,"516 Quadra St, Victoria, BC V8V 3S3, Canada",$30 via etransfer (for 2hr workshop) $40 (if paying at the door),https://www.facebook.com/events/1186024512794534/,workshop,2131.0,2025-04-08 17:55:41.379852,0.0,workshop
