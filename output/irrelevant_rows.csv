Join us at Edelweiss Club for an ecstatic dance journey ~ Sunday, March 2nd features Naomi Jason as our facilitator/dj! Details for Sunday, March 2nd: Facilitation and music set by Naomi Jason (DjNjoy) Doors open at 10:45am Dance from 11am to 12:30pm (guided opening at 11) Sliding scale: $20-$40 (no charge for kids under 12); $15-$20 low income Cash at the door or reserve your place with an etransfer to dancetempleinfo@gmail.com Dance Temple is a weekly Sunday offering. Newcomers welcome! No experience necessary. Please attend only if you feel 100% well. Regular Temple Guidelines (please read through, especially if you're new to Dance Temple): **SHIRTS ON PLEASE** Please keep your shirt on, regardless of your gender (we've decided out of fairness to ask everyone, regardless of gender, to keep their shirts on). ** IF YOU INTEND TO SWEAT ** Please care for yourself and others by: 1) Taking a shower before you arrive 2) Bringing a towel to wipe up any wake you leave behind **SCENT-FREE SPACE** Please refrain from wearing anything scented in the space (including essential oils, lotions or liniments). ** CELL PHONE USE ** By popular request we have a 'no cell phone use' policy in the dance space. Please silence your phone or turn it off altogether. No cameras in the space either! If you need to use your device, please do so in the foyer or outside. As you can imagine, it's distracting otherwise. ** DANCING & CONSENT ** Enjoy your own personal dance or spark up creative movement with others, if there is mutual agreement . If you wish to dance with another, look for eye contact or the body language of an invitation (if that isn't there then it's a 'no'). Remember that a person's willingness to dance can change from moment to moment or week to week. At any time you, or the person you are dancing with, may choose to end the encounter by moving away, or bowing with hands in prayer. ** TALKING ** The dance space is a no-talking zone. This is again done to remove any distractions and to allow for dropping in more fully. If you need to have a conversation, however brief, please step out into the foyer or go outside. If you witness a conversation happening, you are welcome to gently remind people of this request (with a gesture). ** KIDS ** Parents are asked to kindly monitor their kids and keep them close. Please do not permit your kids to run freely through the dance space - this is risky for kids and for dancers. If it's quiet (especially at the beginning and ending), and your kids aren't - please see that they are guided into relative silence. Otherwise we will ask you to take them outside so as not to distract others from the proceedings. **FOOTWEAR** Please wear socks or indoor shoes/sneakers in the dance space. HERE'S MORE OF WHAT DANCE TEMPLE OFFERS: • Practice freedom of expression through movement, while respecting and being aware of those around you. • Tune into an eclectic selection of musical flavors from a revolving lineup of experienced facilitators. • Inspire and explore new ways to move your body. • Explore the altar space for contemplation, reflection and intention setting. • Learn to enter into a state of trance without the use of substances (no drugs or alcohol please). • Non denominational opening and closing (can be in the form of an embodiment practice, prayer or meditation) • Minimal facilitation. You are free to move as you wish. Dance Temple is an inclusive community that celebrates gender diversity and authentic expression. In Closing: Please arrive early or on time so that we may all journey together. Bring a water bottle. Breathe. Take care of yourself, others and the space. Wear comfortable clothing for movement. Be prepared to sweat. We acknowledge with deep respect and gratitude that we gather on unceded Lekwungen Territory, home of the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations.

3244,Texture Your Moves for West Coast Swing,"swing, wcs, west coast swing","We will guide you through practical musicality and movement drills that will 'colour in' any pattern in your repertoire. You'll learn: +++ How you can do more styling without feeling inhibited OR being reckless. +++ How to preserve your partnership connection while still expressing yourself. +++ How to enjoy being musical even with partners who are missing skills. +++ How to respect the rules of the WCS while learning to bend them. Come learn a super practical & universal way to LEVEL UP your musicality by adding body pulse & groove to add more personality and creativity into basic patterns, then get lots of reps to practice these tactics with the appropriate connection and timing. All the while putting these skills to use immediately in your social dancing! In this workshop we are going to take your Feetwork, Bodywork and Grooves you might ALREADY know.. with your common WCS patterns. We will show you ways to texture a  Tandem Slingshot, Hustle Check, Over Rotated Under Arm Turn. Leg Sweep to a Lunge. Do you have a style you just don't like? eg. Honky Tonk blues or lyrical or 12/8 songs. Or how about Rap sections of the song or when the song goes half the speed. Or how about those pesky bastard phrases. This workshop is for you if; You have no idea how to dance differently to different genres of music, so most of your dances look or feel the same. You feel like you are just walking through patterns without any real character to your movement and you feel robotic and stiff. You can do body pulse and contra-body but they are not automatic in your dancing yet. You can't seem to make wise, deliberate choices for texturing your moves to the music. You aren’t able to make your slow tempo songs look distinct from your other genres. **Send e-transfer to reserve your spot to danceyourfreedom@gmail.com Call Jay @ (250) 886-4599 if you have any questions. Please bring shoes or socks & your own water bottle. Space is limited to 14ppl max.

4483,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha Cha - Intermediate/ Advanced,"cha cha, cha cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is for experienced dancers and performers that want to continue to push themselves with more complex techniques. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Monday from 8:00- 9:00pm Must have instructor permission to attend. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition.
