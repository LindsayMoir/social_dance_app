1262,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha- Fundamentals,"cha cha, dance, salsa","Class Description This class is perfect for brand new beginners, dancers of other styles, or more experienced dancers that want to continue to improve technique. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.

1300,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha- Beginner Intermediate,"cha cha, dance, salsa","Class Description This class is dancers that have completed the Fundamentals course and want to continue to improve their social dancing using the techniques they have learned. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 9:00- 10:00pm No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Must have completed Fundamentals or have instructor permission to attend.

This workshop is perfect for exposing your Westie-curious friends to the dance. And if you haven't tried swapping roles, why not try something new, or refresh your favourite dance moves with an Intro to West Coast Swing crash course? West Coast Swing is special in that we do not use traditional male or female roles to dance. In fact, this dance has genderless roles, meaning that anyone can learn how to lead or follow, and many people learn how to do both! Dancing is a way for us to express ourselves, and we encourage everyone to dance in whichever way they prefer! Whether you are dancing as a leader or a follower, you don't need to be amazing in order to enjoy yourself, you just need to learn a few essential skills and the rules of the game to have fun. We'll teach you everything you need to get your groove on to any song, with any partner! Details: August 3 at Dance Vancouver Studio 4:30-6:30 pm Super fun crash course taught by our Swing Literacy instructors 7-8 pm Open WCS class: Get the Funk Out! 8-11 pm WCS dance party - everyone welcome ($15 general admission to the party, workshop attendees attend the party for free!)

From New York Fashion Week to Brooklyn’s iconic Mood Ring, to local haunts like Vicious Poodle for U-Haul and leather dyke nights, her resume is as stacked as her USB. Barbie’s on-stage energy is intoxicating (hey Britney), and her connection with the crowd is something you have to feel to understand. Her sets are high-femme and tell a unique story every time—unapologetically wet, dripping in cvnty vocals, dirty basslines, a genre-blurring blend of house, Top 40, R&B, hyperpop, and whatever her divine intuition tells her to play. After a wildly busy year—including a packed fundraiser at a legendary Montreal strip club with an all-trans cast, raising serious coin for a local trans SW organization—she’s gearing up for a Western Canada Tour. Let your inner diva loose, dance it out, and maybe even find someone to make out with. 👽 🚀 Krista Mac is a queer, enby and feminist performer who loves to throw it back to classic songs throughout their sets. Based on the west coast in Vancouver, B.C., they have opened for artists such as Cobrah, Manilla Luzon, The Funk Hunters, Whitney Day, Netta , and TT The Artist .
