NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Monday from 8:00- 9:00pm Must have instructor permission to attend. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.
