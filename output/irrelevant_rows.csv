In this workshop we are going to take your Feetwork, Bodywork and Grooves you might ALREADY know.. with your common WCS patterns. We will show you ways to texture a  Tandem Slingshot, Hustle Check, Over Rotated Under Arm Turn. Leg Sweep to a Lunge. Do you have a style you just don't like? eg. Honky Tonk blues or lyrical or 12/8 songs. Or how about Rap sections of the song or when the song goes half the speed. Or how about those pesky bastard phrases. This workshop is for you if; You have no idea how to dance differently to different genres of music, so most of your dances look or feel the same. You feel like you are just walking through patterns without any real character to your movement and you feel robotic and stiff. You can do body pulse and contra-body but they are not automatic in your dancing yet. You can't seem to make wise, deliberate choices for texturing your moves to the music. You aren’t able to make your slow tempo songs look distinct from your other genres. **Send e-transfer to reserve your spot to danceyourfreedom@gmail.com Call Jay @ (250) 886-4599 if you have any questions.

NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 9:00- 10:00pm No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Must have completed Fundamentals or have instructor permission to attend. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition. No drop ins permitted so please contact us to reserve your spot!",Tuesday,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,21:00:00,22:00:00,Salsa Caliente,"725 Yates ST, VICTORIA, BC, V8W1L6, CA",,https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NXI2YmZ2YTNtdmJkZ2hnYmpwNmlqNHVhb3FfMjAyNTA4MTNUMDQwMDAwWiAyc2tyaTY1NnNjb2tiNmRxNGJxZms0bmYxc0Bn,"class, social dance",65.0,2025-04-17 13:59:25.858226,0.0,"class, social dance"
