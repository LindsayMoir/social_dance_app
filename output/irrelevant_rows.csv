Same topics as the previous intermediate series, but you're likely to get a little something different every time. Classes will ideally build on each other, but you do not necessarily have complete earlier ones to take the next. Single day drop-ins allowed, but please still send me a message. At least some prior blues dance experience is required. If you have less experience, please consider taking classes in order (especially pulse & groove first). 7:30-9pm Monday nights June. 2, 9, 16, 23 Instructors: Sara Sloan & Candra Marr. $20 per class (cash or e-transfer), $80 for series. Message me (Sara Sloan) to register ahead of time to get the exact address. Please let me know if you need to cancel asap, so I can open up more spots if needed. Due to the small space, I am limiting it to 10 participants. Topics: June 2: Pulse and Groove How to look and feel like a Blues pro. What makes Blues dance look like Blues dance and how do I make my movements feel bluesy? How to connect with your partner with different types of pulses. June 9: Slow Drag All about dancing slow and close embrace. The subtlety, connection and squish. June 16: Connection Blues has a flexibility of connection that allows for more individuality, but how do we stay connected even when we're doing different movements? June 23: Musicality There are as many styles of blues dance as there are styles of blues musichow do I know what styles to dance to this song?

1001,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha- Beginner Intermediate,"cha cha, cha cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is dancers that have completed the Fundamentals course and want to continue to improve their social dancing using the techniques they have learned. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 9:00- 10:00pm No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Must have completed Fundamentals or have instructor permission to attend. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition.

Students should have a solid foundation in basic jazz steps, can easily dance the Tranky-doo/Big Apple/other routines (besides the Shim Sham), and are willing to solo jam and sing (mezzo forte!) with their classmates. Lucy Falkner & Lindsay Leong: Lindy Hop for experienced dancers – Students should have completed at least a few Intermediate sessions and/or be in the Team program. We will challenge your connection and improvisation skills with a complex combination; practice will include working your own variations and improvisations into the combination. (“Combination” = a 32-bar / 4 x 8-count sequence of moves.) The day starts with a dance warm-up/workout with Lucy.
