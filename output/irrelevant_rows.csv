NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition.

NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Monday from 8:00- 9:00pm Must have instructor permission to attend. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.

5082,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha Cha - Intermediate/ Advanced,"cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is for experienced dancers and performers that want to continue to push themselves with more complex techniques. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Monday from 8:00- 9:00pm Must have instructor permission to attend. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition.

5088,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha Cha - Intermediate/ Advanced,"cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is for experienced dancers and performers that want to continue to push themselves with more complex techniques. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Monday from 8:00- 9:00pm Must have instructor permission to attend. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition.

A consummate performer, she slips easily from sassy to sexy within a single line of lyrics, at times echoing the haunting tones of Etta James and Carmen McRae, then faster than the mind and ear can make the transition, Maureen Washington exudes the impish irreverence of Jann Arden and the vocal agility of Holly Cole. With all splendor attached to such comparisons, Maureen’s musical style remains distinctly her own. Her vocal diversity lends itself to performances of blues, swing jazz and funk , and her versatile repertoire, ranges from classics to lively originals. It's been a while since we've presented Maureen, her shows are usually sold out, so make sure to get your tickets in advance!",Friday,2025-09-12,2025-09-12,19:30:00,21:30:00,eventbrite,"Upstairs Lounge, Oak Bay Recreation Centre, 1975 Bee Street, Oak Bay, BC V8R 5E6",CA$34.94,https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/maureen-washington-friends-tickets-1233255383049?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,live music,1303.0,2025-05-27 17:40:08.610217,0.0,live music
