NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 9:00- 10:00pm No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Must have completed Fundamentals or have instructor permission to attend.

Contact flow is an evening of connection and play through contact improvisation, solo movement exploration and ecstatic dance. We begin in quiet ritual — tea will be lovingly served from 7:00 to 7:30 PM, inviting you to slow down, arrive, and gently attune to yourself and the space. At 7:30, we transition into an embodied dance journey — a lightly facilitated space with a curated playlist, that welcomes contact improvisation, ecstatic expression, and authentic movement. At 9pm we will gather in a closing circle to share and harvest our experiences. As somatic facilitators, our intention with this weekly gathering is to weave community through dance; attune to our bodies & the bodies of others; and explore authentic movement in a safe, tender, & courageous way.",Friday,2025-08-29,2025-08-29,19:00:00,21:15:00,Ashtanga Yoga Victoria,"University of Victoria Students’ Society, 3800 Finnerty, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, CA",$15,https://www.facebook.com/events/726107323159359/,social dance,543,2025-08-04 15:47:15.031449,0.0,social dance

Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.
