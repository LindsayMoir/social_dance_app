4707,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha- Fundamentals,"cha cha, cha cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is perfect for brand new beginners, dancers of other styles, or more experienced dancers that want to continue to improve technique. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition.

4729,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha- Fundamentals,"cha cha, cha cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is perfect for brand new beginners, dancers of other styles, or more experienced dancers that want to continue to improve technique. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson. Call 250-881-6141 or email info@calientedance.com for more details. * Please arrive no earlier than 5 min before class to allow for smooth class transition.

NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.

NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Tuesday from 8:00- 9:00pm No experience or partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.
