This 3 day event will be in one of Western Canada's prettiest and artsiest small towns. Registration is by individual or pair, no partner required. However, we will strive for role balance at this event, so we recommend signing up with a partner. The intention for this event is to create a fabulous series of Milongas, with generous food and drink offerings, and a warm atmosphere of mutual inclusion and respect. We seek to honor the codigos and traditions of Argentine Tango and to create an atmosphere of camaraderie and togetherness. All Tango styles are welcome as long as good floorcraft and consideration for others is maintained. So looking forward to sharing our little town and big hearts with you! We have a lot of great moments mapped out for you on this weekend, Prize draws, group meals, parties, and some fun ice-breaker activities during registration times before the opening Milonga on Friday and throughout the weekend Passes and more info: www.nelsonbctango.com . If you are new to Tango Marathons, the idea is simple: it's like a festival except that instead of focusing on classes, we focus on the Milongas and time on the floor spent dancing.

Please keep scents to a minimum to consider the space's requirements and people attending's sensitivities Smoking: please just make sure that you are smoking far enough away from the door that the scent doesn't enter the building. What is Fusion Dancing? Fusion is not really a style. It’s an idea, a philosophy, a way of being with ourselves and others, the music and movement, that allows a partner dance to be something unique and different every time. What would happen if you came to a partner dance with no expectations – just to listen and be heard?  What would happen if you and your partner knew how to speak and listen the language of movement beyond patterns?  What would happen if “leading” and “following” didn’t have to do with your gender?  What would happen if the roles of “leading” and “following” blended together, flowing in and out of each other moment to moment?",Friday,2025-06-06,2025-06-06,18:00:00,21:50:00,Westie Inspiration,"Unitarian Fellowship of Nanaimo Rites of Passage, Unit 1, 595 Townsite Road, Nanaimo",$5-20 (sliding scale),https://www.facebook.com/events/1061805582492361/,social dance,,2025-06-03 15:14:49.609424,0.0,social dance
