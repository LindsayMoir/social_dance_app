3077,Texture Your Moves for West Coast Swing,"swing, wcs, west coast swing","We will guide you through practical musicality and movement drills that will 'colour in' any pattern in your repertoire. You'll learn how to do more styling without feeling inhibited or being reckless, preserve your partnership connection while still expressing yourself, enjoy being musical even with partners who are missing skills, and respect the rules of the WCS while learning to bend them. Come learn a super practical & universal way to LEVEL UP your musicality by adding body pulse & groove to add more personality and creativity into basic patterns, then get lots of reps to practice these tactics with the appropriate connection and timing. All the while putting these skills to use immediately in your social dancing! In this workshop we are going to take your Feetwork, Bodywork and Grooves you might ALREADY know.. with your common WCS patterns. We will show you ways to texture a Tandem Slingshot, Hustle Check, Over Rotated Under Arm Turn. Leg Sweep to a Lunge. This workshop is for you if; You have no idea how to dance differently to different genres of music, so most of your dances look or feel the same. You feel like you are just walking through patterns without any real character to your movement and you feel robotic and stiff. You can do body pulse and contra-body but they are not automatic in your dancing yet. You can't seem to make wise, deliberate choices for texturing your moves to the music. You aren’t able to make your slow tempo songs look distinct from your other genres. **Send e-transfer to reserve your spot to danceyourfreedom@gmail.com Call Jay @ (250) 886-4599 if you have any questions.

1259,Salsa On 2 & Cha Cha Cha - Intermediate/ Advanced,"cha cha, cha cha cha, salsa","Class Description This class is for experienced dancers and performers that want to continue to push themselves with more complex techniques. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor. Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Every Monday from 8:00- 9:00pm Must have instructor permission to attend. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.
