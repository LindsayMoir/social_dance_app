Come home to yourself, find connection and nourishment in community, and with the land. Together we take refuge in our primary language 'rhythm', and find belonging in the dance. This retreat weaves the transformative movement practice of the 5Rhythms® together with heart-centred communication, land-based rituals, and embodied leadership. Sessions will be held indoors and outdoors. Embodiment practices will unleash your creative spirit and support you in finding authentic expression of body, heart and mind. No previous dance experience is necessary. Every body is welcome. This is a residential retreat with 3 gourmet meals per day and optional additional activities like morning yoga, kayaking, garden tours or Hollyhock’s famous beach oyster bbq. Sessions will be held indoors and outdoors. The retreat starts with dinner on June 9th and completes with lunch on June 14th. Accommodation ranges from camping to private rooms.
