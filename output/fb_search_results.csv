See less Victoria, British Columbia Victoria Scout House 505 Marigold, Victoria On Dec. 11, 1909, Esquimalt resident Lt.-Col. John A. Hall, former commanding officer of the 5th Regiment Canadian Army, initiated a meeting held in the Menzies Street Drill Hall in James Bay to see if there was sufficient interest in the area to form a Boy Scout troop. Seventy-two boys attended. On Jan. 11, 1910 the next step was taken at Hall’s home on Old Esquimalt Road to establish the first council of the Victoria Boy Scouts Association. Hall, instrumental in the organization of the 88th Victoria Fusiliers, was a natural choice to chair the council. In March 1910, the first badges were issued by the council and six troops organized, with the Esquimalt troop assigned 1st Arbutus,’ the name still in use today. In June, the first parade with all scouts in uniform was held at the drill hall after which Edgar Fawcett presented a Union Jack with the letters “V.B.S.” (Victoria Boy Scouts) in the centre. This brigade flag as it was known was presented to the troop with the largest number of scouts on parade. Guests See All"
