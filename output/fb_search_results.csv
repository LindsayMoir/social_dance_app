Brooke Bachand with guitar phenom Charlie Gannon, plus the dynamic duo Hildaland, from Orkney and the US! Orkney (Scotland) born fiddler Louise Bichan and Indiana (USA) mandolinist Ethan Setiawan present a collaboration and meeting of their musical worlds in Hildaland. A path steeped in the fiddle traditions of their respective sides of the Atlantic, the journey taken wends through Scottish and American soil, celebrating their foundations while intertwining with contemporary composition. Bichan‚Äôs fiddle is a melodic foil to Setiawan‚Äôs counterpoint and harmonic depth, and the two weave in and out seamlessly. Setiawan has won such accolades as the 2014 National Mandolin Championship , the 2017 RockyGrass Mandolin Championship and has shared the stage with the likes of Julian Lage, Darrell Scott,  Bryan Sutton, Mike Marshall, Tony Trischka, Darol Anger, Casey Driessen, the Steel Wheels, Don Stiernberg, Matt Flinner, and Jacob Jolliff. Bichan has won awards for her compositions and playing, and has travelled far and wide to perform in various line ups since a young age. She has appeared at the likes of the BBC TV's Hogmanay Live show, Edinburgh  Castle, Reading Festival, Cambridge Folk Festival, Lorient Interceltique Festival, Milwaukee Irish Festival and Sligo Live festival. In 2016 she released her first solo album, Out of My Own Light , to great acclaim. Two time Irish Music Awards Winner Q Brooke Bachand is an established and recognized international touring artist well known for their duo work with younger brother Quinn. The siblings have garnered international acclaim and a mantle packing collection of awards and recognition, performing at folk and Celtic festivals across Canada, the US and Europe. Non-binary west-coast artist Q Brooke Bachand , now known as 'Q' , formerly Qristina Bachand is a consummate performer who is clearly at ease on stage. Known for their powerful fiddle, captivating vocals and their contagious energy, their love of Folk and Celtic music is always at the forefront as they bless audiences with energetic and spirited performances that showcase their fiddle & vocal talents as well as their love of story-sharing. Q is joined by local guitar phenom Charlie Gannon . Charlie is recognized as one of the best young guitarists in Victoria, playing a wide range of styles from Celtic to Rock. His playing is highly technical yet sensitive, with inventive harmonies and chord voicings he has learned from many years of playing jazz. He brings new life to the simplest of songs and performs even the most difficult with ease. https://www.sassafrashillproductions.com/hildaland https://qthey.ca https://charliegannon.com Doors open at 6 pm for dinner service, the concert starts at 7:30 pm Please note this is a LISTENING VENUE See less Victoria, British Columbia Tickets You can find tickets for this event on Eventbrite.

By coming together to sing songs of liberation, we honor their struggles and continue their legacy of collective strength and imagining. Participants are invited to share one or two songs centered on themes of liberation, freedom, and resistance. Along with their performance, they are encouraged to briefly explain the song‚Äôs meaning, history, or personal significance, helping to deepen our collective understanding and connection to the music and its message. These can be originals or covers. Please try to arrange your song so that folks can sing, strum, or clap along at times with extended refrains for harmonizing and open instrumental sections with simple chords for jamming. Bring a few copies of a chart if you like! Interspersed between the songs, we will have a few singalongs with lyrics and chords provided. Harmonizing is encouraged and feel free to bring an acoustic instrument. Oppressive themes and messages will not be welcome into this song circle. All songs shared in this circle should, in their own unique way, call for an end to exploitation and discrimination. Admission: $10.

Combining powerful vocals, driving guitar, inventive harmonies on the fiddle, hard-hitting Irish banjo, sprightly leads on the whistle and mandolin, the powerful heartbeat of the bodhran, and the ancient ambience of the Irish lever harp, the Hounds' textured and energetic arrangements invite listeners to be swept up in the stories, to sing along and stamp their feet - true to the tradition of folk! The group is led by seasoned performer and composer Wolf Edwards on lead vocal and guitar, and joined by Madeleine Townley on vocals, Irish harp, and tin whistle, Briana Kennedy on fiddle, Dexter Simpson on Irish tenor banjo, Ben Garrison on mandolin, Jeff Feltmate on bodhran and second fiddle, and Theo Waite on double bass. Joining the Hounds for the Pogues Tribute are Craig Frew on accordion and Caleb Belknap-Crippen on drums! The Hounds of Cuchulain have reached their two year anniversary! Since their inception they have performed over 200 shows at major folk festivals, theaters, pubs, community events, private functions and more. The band has released two full length albums, and just finished recording an album of originals!

Join us for the Opening Reception on Thursday March 13, from 5-8pm.  Artists will be in attendance. Admission to the Massey Sales Gallery is always free! Pop Art, emerging in the late 1950s and ‚Äô60s, drew inspiration from commercial and popular culture. It lacked a specific style but responded to postwar commodity-driven values by using everyday objects like comic strips and soup cans as subjects. This movement was a descendant of Dada, which critiqued contemporary art and the political and cultural climate of its time.  Hoey-X≈çchitl, comprised of local Victoria artists Tim Hoey and Zandra X≈çchitl are, as they put it, ‚Äúthe super-fun-totally-bonkers collab of 2 very different styles of art that shouldn‚Äôt really work together, but do.‚Äù Nothing to See Here: Show & Sale runs from March 13, 2025 to April 27, 2025. --- About Hoey-X≈çchitl: Part of the motivation and inspiration for this collaboration is that nothing is too precious‚Äîwe‚Äôre cooking with stuff we mostly already have lying around in our respective studios and throwing things in the mix without getting in each others way too much. It‚Äôs meant to stretch us creatively, try new things (I don‚Äôt know, just google something in latin!) and see what happens without attachment. --- The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria is located on the traditional territories of the Lekwungen peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations. We extend our appreciation for the opportunity to live and learn on this territory. The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria is committed to providing a welcoming and accessible destination for all to enjoy. The main entrance is wheelchair accessible with a ramp on the left side of the entrance with no handrail. There is one set of power doors located at the left side of the entrance at the top of the ramp. --- Image Credit: Hoey-X≈çchit, This Gold Tooth Won‚Äôt Pay for ITSELF, 48 x 48‚Ä≥ mixed media on panel See less Victoria, British Columbia 1040 Moss Street, Victoria, BC, Canada, British Columbia V8V 4P1 1040 Moss St, Victoria, BC V8V 4P1, Canada Guests See All"
