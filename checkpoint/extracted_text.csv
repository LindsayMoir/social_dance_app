These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance.

It was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of the City of Victoria. The Victoria Police Station, city hall and McPherson Playhouse are adjacent to the square. There is a fountain in the square.In the summer, the city hires musicians to perform every weekday, charging no admission fee. For the British Columbia Day holiday, Centennial Square is one of the venues for the Victoria Electronic Music Festival, where musicians and DJs play for free.In the winter, the Downtown Victoria Business Association has temporarily set up Christmas lights, a Ferris wheel, and an ice skating rink in the square.In 2011, Occupy Victoria protesters camped in the square until a court, at the behest of the city, ordered them to leave.

This year’s event has been completely reinvented: THRASH now stands for “Thank Heavens Racing And Summer are Here” – and we mean it. We’ve shifted from spring to summer to take full advantage of longer days, warmer temperatures, and (with a bit of luck) the most reliable westerly breeze of the year. Expect later daily start times to make the most of those afternoon winds. The racing action begins Friday evening with a Random Leg Race for all divisions, followed by two full days of high-quality racing on Saturday and Sunday. The regatta is open to all keelboats and multihulls competing in PHRF, ORC, One Design, and Cruising divisions.

Seminar series for Tango Dancers that want to transform their way of moving and connecting! We will travel through the Essentials of Tango in order to look for new answers and deeper understanding. What makes tango truly captivating? It’s the embrace, the connection, and the walk. These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance.

You will choose a champion of the common folk and equip them with a powerful weapon of legend. Together they will lead your armies into battle to win victory and glory for the realm. Discover your next favorite format. This will be a 3 Round (Best of 1) 1v1 Commander Variant Tournament, prizing out for players with positive records. Random Draws for Random Prizes, all participants receive a random Promo/Rare/Mythic. One player will win a ""Most Fun to Play With"" Prize voted by majority. As this format is pretty new we thought it would be fun to give it a swing as a 1v1 before we try a 4v4 tournament. Build something fun, don't come to crush. How it Works Pendragon is ultimately a Commander/EDH variant and therefore follows most of the same rules and regulations. Below is the basic setup and ways in which the format deviates from its predecessors. If a deviation is not explicitly stated, the default rules of Commander/EDH should be followed. Deck Size: 100 Card Singleton (4v4 or 1v1) Commanders: 1 Common Creature 1 Legendary Equipment *See MDFC & Reconfigure Equipment notes below Color Identity: Color identity is a combination of the color identity of the creature commander and the equipment. Cards in the 98: All cards not designated as commanders must be of common rarity or have a printing at common rarity (to include all cards downshifted to common on MTGO). (Format Deck Legal Cards) Life Total/Commander Damage: Life total is set at 30 Commander Damage is set at 21 points of combat damage from a single commander (this includes an equipment in the case in which an equipment commander is animated/becomes a creature) *MDFC Note: MDFC equipment is allowed in the Command Zone, but only the equipment side may be cast from the any zone. In the event that an MDFC equipment card is sent to any zone other than the Command Zone, it is treated as single sided equipment artifact and the non-equipment side of the card cannot be cast, summoned, or interacted with in any way; as if it did not exist. *Reconfigure Equipment Creatures Note: Currently only one Legendary Artifact Creature - Equipment exists, The Reality Chip. This is considered a legal Excalibur and can also inflict its own commander damage. If additional Legendary Artifact Creature - Equipment spells are released in the future they will also follow this ruling unless otherwise stated.

Class Description This class is dancers that have completed the Fundamentals course and want to continue to improve their social dancing using the techniques they  have learned. NY Style Salsa (Mambo) is danced to the rhythm of the congas and the techniques used allow for quick turns and direction changes, complex partner patterns and more body movement while dancing on a crowded dance floor.  Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both. Classes are registered on a monthly basis and take place every Tuesday from 9:00- 10:00pm. Mar 4, 11, 18, 25 No partner is necessary as we rotate partners throughout the lesson.

Sunday May 11, come celebrate Mother’s Day with an evening of beautiful music! Two of Canadas foremost guitarists join together for an unparalleled evening of spectacular music. Having achieved impeccable musicianship and craft during his European conservatory training, Eric Harper took on the new challenge of studying film scoring at Berklee School of Music. By the time of his graduation, Eric had found his full stride as composer-singer-songwriter, with a style that evokes a mad but moving medley of The Dave Matthews Band, the Gipsy Kings and music a la Cirque du Soleil. Eric’s live show melds a bravura virtuosity with hilarity and heart-felt storytelling from his times living, learning, and loving deeply in multiple countries and cultures. As anyone who has seen an Eric Harper show can attest, there will be a lot of laughs and tears and dancing. Award winning Latin guitarist Doug Towle combines Salsa, Jazz, Flamenco and Pop to create a truly unique musical experience. Doug Towle is one of Canada’s premier guitarists. He has performed across North America in such prestigious events as Guitar Player Live in San Francisco, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, The Zihuatenejo Guitar Festival in Mexico, several appearances at the Juan De Fuca Festival and the Harmony Arts Festival among countless other festival and club stages. In 2009 Guitar Player Magazine selected Doug from among thousands of hopefuls as a top ten finalist in their Guitar Superstar Competition, solidifying his reputation as one of the top players not only in Canada but globally.

Millions of listeners were introduced to their undeniably fresh sound through viral videos, featuring the band’s exuberant chemistry, effortless musicality, and raw ambition. After meeting as students at The Juilliard School, core members Sebastian Rios (bassist/composer) and TJ Reddick (drummer) began playing in the parks of NYC during lock-down in 2020 and frequently collaborating with pianist Emmet Cohen. Releases such as MF Doom Suite, Harlem to Havana, and cook/swing/work/relax demonstrate their reverence towards jazz icons, yet establish their own voice and new sounds that transcend genres. Reddick and Rios have played as sidemen for Jon Batiste, Sullivan Fortner, and ELEW, among many more, and Rios is a long-time student of legendary bassist Ron Carter. NJU’s album Dying of Thirst just released in 2025. Dynamic and powerful performers, New Jazz Underground is re-energizing contemporary music from the inside out, blazing a path for young jazz musicians in the modern music landscape.

Sunday May 11, come celebrate Mother’s Day with an evening of beautiful music! Two of Canadas foremost guitarists join together for an unparalleled evening of spectacular music. Having achieved impeccable musicianship and craft during his European conservatory training, Eric Harper took on the new challenge of studying film scoring at Berklee School of Music. By the time of his graduation, Eric had found his full stride as composer-singer-songwriter, with a style that evokes a mad but moving medley of The Dave Matthews Band, the Gipsy Kings and music a la Cirque du Soleil. Eric’s live show melds a bravura virtuosity with hilarity and heart-felt storytelling from his times living, learning, and loving deeply in multiple countries and cultures. As anyone who has seen an Eric Harper show can attest, there will be a lot of laughs and tears and dancing. Award winning Latin guitarist Doug Towle combines Salsa, Jazz, Flamenco and Pop to create a truly unique musical experience. Doug Towle is one of Canada’s premier guitarists. He has performed across North America in such prestigious events as Guitar Player Live in San Francisco, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, The Zihuatenejo Guitar Festival in Mexico, several appearances at the Juan De Fuca Festival and the Harmony Arts Festival among countless other festival and club stages. In 2009 Guitar Player Magazine selected Doug from among thousands of hopefuls as a top ten finalist in their Guitar Superstar Competition, solidifying his reputation as one of the top players not only in Canada but globally.

The studio is known to get warm with more bodies in the space so we want you to stay healthy and hydrated. • Personal hygiene is important! Consider bringing a towel and/or a spare shirt to change into if you sweat easily. Our studio has a bathroom and change rooms available for all to use. • We recommend wearing clothes that are easy to move in, especially pants given the nature of the dance. • Clean, comfortable shoes (ideally dance shoes) on the dance floor only!

Millions of listeners were introduced to their undeniably fresh sound through viral videos, featuring the band’s exuberant chemistry, effortless musicality, and raw ambition. After meeting as students at The Juilliard School, core members Sebastian Rios (bassist/composer) and TJ Reddick (drummer) began playing in the parks of NYC during lock-down in 2020 and frequently collaborating with pianist Emmet Cohen. Releases such as MF Doom Suite, Harlem to Havana, and cook/swing/work/relax demonstrate their reverence towards jazz icons, yet establish their own voice and new sounds that transcend genres. Reddick and Rios have played as sidemen for Jon Batiste, Sullivan Fortner, and ELEW, among many more, and Rios is a long-time student of legendary bassist Ron Carter. NJU’s album Dying of Thirst just released in 2025. Dynamic and powerful performers, New Jazz Underground is re-energizing contemporary music from the inside out, blazing a path for young jazz musicians in the modern music landscape.

Sunday May 11, come celebrate Mother’s Day with an evening of beautiful music! Two of Canadas foremost guitarists join together for an unparalleled evening of spectacular music. Having achieved impeccable musicianship and craft during his European conservatory training, Eric Harper took on the new challenge of studying film scoring at Berklee School of Music. By the time of his graduation, Eric had found his full stride as composer-singer-songwriter, with a style that evokes a mad but moving medley of The Dave Matthews Band, the Gipsy Kings and music a la Cirque du Soleil. Eric’s live show melds a bravura virtuosity with hilarity and heart-felt storytelling from his times living, learning, and loving deeply in multiple countries and cultures. As anyone who has seen an Eric Harper show can attest, there will be a lot of laughs and tears and dancing. Award winning Latin guitarist Doug Towle combines Salsa, Jazz, Flamenco and Pop to create a truly unique musical experience. Doug Towle is one of Canada’s premier guitarists. He has performed across North America in such prestigious events as Guitar Player Live in San Francisco, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, The Zihuatenejo Guitar Festival in Mexico, several appearances at the Juan De Fuca Festival and the Harmony Arts Festival among countless other festival and club stages. In 2009 Guitar Player Magazine selected Doug from among thousands of hopefuls as a top ten finalist in their Guitar Superstar Competition, solidifying his reputation as one of the top players not only in Canada but globally.

Good vibes only! • If you would like to partake in a steal dance, try to remain with that group for the whole song. • Bring a water bottle! The studio is known to get warm with more bodies in the space so we want you to stay healthy and hydrated. • Personal hygiene is important! Consider bringing a towel and/or a spare shirt to change into if you sweat easily. Our studio has a bathroom and change rooms available for all to use. • We recommend wearing clothes that are easy to move in, especially pants given the nature of the dance. • Clean, comfortable shoes (ideally dance shoes) on the dance floor only!

After meeting as students at The Juilliard School, core members Sebastian Rios (bassist/composer) and TJ Reddick (drummer) began playing in the parks of NYC during lock-down in 2020 and frequently collaborating with pianist Emmet Cohen. Releases such as MF Doom Suite, Harlem to Havana, and cook/swing/work/relax demonstrate their reverence towards jazz icons, yet establish their own voice and new sounds that transcend genres. Reddick and Rios have played as sidemen for Jon Batiste, Sullivan Fortner, and ELEW, among many more, and Rios is a long-time student of legendary bassist Ron Carter. NJU’s album Dying of Thirst just released in 2025. Dynamic and powerful performers, New Jazz Underground is re-energizing contemporary music from the inside out, blazing a path for young jazz musicians in the modern music landscape.

Sunday May 11, come celebrate Mother’s Day with an evening of beautiful music! Two of Canadas foremost guitarists join together for an unparalleled evening of spectacular music. Having achieved impeccable musicianship and craft during his European conservatory training, Eric Harper took on the new challenge of studying film scoring at Berklee School of Music. By the time of his graduation, Eric had found his full stride as composer-singer-songwriter, with a style that evokes a mad but moving medley of The Dave Matthews Band, the Gipsy Kings and music a la Cirque du Soleil. Eric’s live show melds a bravura virtuosity with hilarity and heart-felt storytelling from his times living, learning, and loving deeply in multiple countries and cultures. As anyone who has seen an Eric Harper show can attest, there will be a lot of laughs and tears and dancing. Award winning Latin guitarist Doug Towle combines Salsa, Jazz, Flamenco and Pop to create a truly unique musical experience. Doug Towle is one of Canada’s premier guitarists. He has performed across North America in such prestigious events as Guitar Player Live in San Francisco, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, The Zihuatenejo Guitar Festival in Mexico, several appearances at the Juan De Fuca Festival and the Harmony Arts Festival among countless other festival and club stages. In 2009 Guitar Player Magazine selected Doug from among thousands of hopefuls as a top ten finalist in their Guitar Superstar Competition, solidifying his reputation as one of the top players not only in Canada but globally.

The studio is known to get warm with more bodies in the space so we want you to stay healthy and hydrated. • Personal hygiene is important! Consider bringing a towel and/or a spare shirt to change into if you sweat easily. Our studio has a bathroom and change rooms available for all to use. • We recommend wearing clothes that are easy to move in, especially pants given the nature of the dance. • Clean, comfortable shoes (ideally dance shoes) on the dance floor only!

Millions of listeners were introduced to their undeniably fresh sound through viral videos, featuring the band’s exuberant chemistry, effortless musicality, and raw ambition. After meeting as students at The Juilliard School, core members Sebastian Rios (bassist/composer) and TJ Reddick (drummer) began playing in the parks of NYC during lock-down in 2020 and frequently collaborating with pianist Emmet Cohen. Releases such as MF Doom Suite, Harlem to Havana, and cook/swing/work/relax demonstrate their reverence towards jazz icons, yet establish their own voice and new sounds that transcend genres. Reddick and Rios have played as sidemen for Jon Batiste, Sullivan Fortner, and ELEW, among many more, and Rios is a long-time student of legendary bassist Ron Carter. NJU’s album Dying of Thirst just released in 2025. Dynamic and powerful performers, New Jazz Underground is re-energizing contemporary music from the inside out, blazing a path for young jazz musicians in the modern music landscape.

Sunday May 11, come celebrate Mother’s Day with an evening of beautiful music! Two of Canadas foremost guitarists join together for an unparalleled evening of spectacular music. Having achieved impeccable musicianship and craft during his European conservatory training, Eric Harper took on the new challenge of studying film scoring at Berklee School of Music. By the time of his graduation, Eric had found his full stride as composer-singer-songwriter, with a style that evokes a mad but moving medley of The Dave Matthews Band, the Gipsy Kings and music a la Cirque du Soleil. Eric’s live show melds a bravura virtuosity with hilarity and heart-felt storytelling from his times living, learning, and loving deeply in multiple countries and cultures. As anyone who has seen an Eric Harper show can attest, there will be a lot of laughs and tears and dancing. Award winning Latin guitarist Doug Towle combines Salsa, Jazz, Flamenco and Pop to create a truly unique musical experience. Doug Towle is one of Canada’s premier guitarists. He has performed across North America in such prestigious events as Guitar Player Live in San Francisco, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, The Zihuatenejo Guitar Festival in Mexico, several appearances at the Juan De Fuca Festival and the Harmony Arts Festival among countless other festival and club stages. In 2009 Guitar Player Magazine selected Doug from among thousands of hopefuls as a top ten finalist in their Guitar Superstar Competition, solidifying his reputation as one of the top players not only in Canada but globally.

The city fell, and in order to maintain control over it, and to prevent the Catalans from rebelling as they had in the previous century, Philip V built the citadel of Barcelona, at that time the largest fortress in Europe.A substantial part of the district it was constructed in (La Ribera) was destroyed to obtain the necessary space, leaving its inhabitants homeless. The fortress was characterized by having five corners, which gave the citadel defensive power, and by a rather wide surrounding margin, serving as location for the army's cannons.

Millions of listeners were introduced to their undeniably fresh sound through viral videos, featuring the band’s exuberant chemistry, effortless musicality, and raw ambition. After meeting as students at The Juilliard School, core members Sebastian Rios (bassist/composer) and TJ Reddick (drummer) began playing in the parks of NYC during lock-down in 2020 and frequently collaborating with pianist Emmet Cohen. Releases such as MF Doom Suite, Harlem to Havana, and cook/swing/work/relax demonstrate their reverence towards jazz icons, yet establish their own voice and new sounds that transcend genres. Reddick and Rios have played as sidemen for Jon Batiste, Sullivan Fortner, and ELEW, among many more, and Rios is a long-time student of legendary bassist Ron Carter. NJU’s album Dying of Thirst just released in 2025. Dynamic and powerful performers, New Jazz Underground is re-energizing contemporary music from the inside out, blazing a path for young jazz musicians in the modern music landscape.

Sunday May 11, come celebrate Mother’s Day with an evening of beautiful music! Two of Canadas foremost guitarists join together for an unparalleled evening of spectacular music. Having achieved impeccable musicianship and craft during his European conservatory training, Eric Harper took on the new challenge of studying film scoring at Berklee School of Music. By the time of his graduation, Eric had found his full stride as composer-singer-songwriter, with a style that evokes a mad but moving medley of The Dave Matthews Band, the Gipsy Kings and music a la Cirque du Soleil. Eric’s live show melds a bravura virtuosity with hilarity and heart-felt storytelling from his times living, learning, and loving deeply in multiple countries and cultures. As anyone who has seen an Eric Harper show can attest, there will be a lot of laughs and tears and dancing. Award winning Latin guitarist Doug Towle combines Salsa, Jazz, Flamenco and Pop to create a truly unique musical experience. Doug Towle is one of Canada’s premier guitarists. He has performed across North America in such prestigious events as Guitar Player Live in San Francisco, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, The Zihuatenejo Guitar Festival in Mexico, several appearances at the Juan De Fuca Festival and the Harmony Arts Festival among countless other festival and club stages. In 2009 Guitar Player Magazine selected Doug from among thousands of hopefuls as a top ten finalist in their Guitar Superstar Competition, solidifying his reputation as one of the top players not only in Canada but globally.

Millions of listeners were introduced to their undeniably fresh sound through viral videos, featuring the band’s exuberant chemistry, effortless musicality, and raw ambition. After meeting as students at The Juilliard School, core members Sebastian Rios (bassist/composer) and TJ Reddick (drummer) began playing in the parks of NYC during lock-down in 2020 and frequently collaborating with pianist Emmet Cohen. Releases such as MF Doom Suite, Harlem to Havana, and cook/swing/work/relax demonstrate their reverence towards jazz icons, yet establish their own voice and new sounds that transcend genres. Reddick and Rios have played as sidemen for Jon Batiste, Sullivan Fortner, and ELEW, among many more, and Rios is a long-time student of legendary bassist Ron Carter. NJU’s album Dying of Thirst just released in 2025. Dynamic and powerful performers, New Jazz Underground is re-energizing contemporary music from the inside out, blazing a path for young jazz musicians in the modern music landscape.
