Seminar series for Tango Dancers that want to transform their way of moving and connecting! We will travel through the Essentials of Tango in order to look for new answers and deeper understanding.

These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance.

Seminar series for Tango Dancers that want to transform their way of moving and connecting! We will travel through the Essentials of Tango in order to look for new answers and deeper understanding. What makes tango truly captivating? It’s the embrace, the connection, and the walk. These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance. We will apply all this to: The secrets to generating power for boleos effortlessly off and on axis special follower technique class Pro tips to dance with ease and confidence 90 min class - $30 All 3 classes - $80 To register email grazs@shaw.ca or pm me, or talk to me .
