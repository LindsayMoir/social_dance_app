Seminar series for Tango Dancers that want to transform their way of moving and connecting! We will travel through the Essentials of Tango in order to look for new answers and deeper understanding.

These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance.

You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated.

It was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of the City of Victoria. The Victoria Police Station, city hall and McPherson Playhouse are adjacent to the square. There is a fountain in the square.In the summer, the city hires musicians to perform every weekday, charging no admission fee. For the British Columbia Day holiday, Centennial Square is one of the venues for the Victoria Electronic Music Festival, where musicians and DJs play for free.In the winter, the Downtown Victoria Business Association has temporarily set up Christmas lights, a Ferris wheel, and an ice skating rink in the square.In 2011, Occupy Victoria protesters camped in the square until a court, at the behest of the city, ordered them to leave.

The Royal Victoria Yacht Club is thrilled to invite you to the revamped and rescheduled THRASH Regatta 2025, happening over the summer solstice weekend, June 20th–22nd. This year’s event has been completely reinvented: THRASH now stands for “Thank Heavens Racing And Summer are Here” – and we mean it. We’ve shifted from spring to summer to take full advantage of longer days, warmer temperatures, and (with a bit of luck) the most reliable westerly breeze of the year. Expect later daily start times to make the most of those afternoon winds. The racing action begins Friday evening with a Random Leg Race for all divisions, followed by two full days of high-quality racing on Saturday and Sunday. The regatta is open to all keelboats and multihulls competing in PHRF, ORC, One Design, and Cruising divisions.

Seminar series for Tango Dancers that want to transform their way of moving and connecting! We will travel through the Essentials of Tango in order to look for new answers and deeper understanding. What makes tango truly captivating? It’s the embrace, the connection, and the walk. These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance. We will apply all this to: The secrets to generating power for boleos effortlessly off and on axis special follower technique class Pro tips to dance with ease and confidence 90 min class - $30 All 3 classes - $80 To register email grazs@shaw.ca or pm me, or talk to me .
