It was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of the City of Victoria. The Victoria Police Station, city hall and McPherson Playhouse are adjacent to the square. There is a fountain in the square.In the summer, the city hires musicians to perform every weekday, charging no admission fee. For the British Columbia Day holiday, Centennial Square is one of the venues for the Victoria Electronic Music Festival, where musicians and DJs play for free.In the winter, the Downtown Victoria Business Association has temporarily set up Christmas lights, a Ferris wheel, and an ice skating rink in the square.In 2011, Occupy Victoria protesters camped in the square until a court, at the behest of the city, ordered them to leave.

It was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of the City of Victoria. The Victoria Police Station, city hall and McPherson Playhouse are adjacent to the square. There is a fountain in the square.In the summer, the city hires musicians to perform every weekday, charging no admission fee. For the British Columbia Day holiday, Centennial Square is one of the venues for the Victoria Electronic Music Festival, where musicians and DJs play for free.In the winter, the Downtown Victoria Business Association has temporarily set up Christmas lights, a Ferris wheel, and an ice skating rink in the square.In 2011, Occupy Victoria protesters camped in the square until a court, at the behest of the city, ordered them to leave.

Seminar series for Tango Dancers that want to transform their way of moving and connecting! We will travel through the Essentials of Tango in order to look for new answers and deeper understanding. What makes tango truly captivating? It‚Äôs the embrace, the connection, and the walk. These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You‚Äôll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance. We will apply all this to: The secrets to generating power for boleos effortlessly off and on axis special follower technique class Pro tips to dance with ease and confidence 90 min class - $30 All 3 classes - $80 To register email grazs@shaw.ca or pm me, or talk to me .

Let's make this month just as much fun! Come join us on May 4th for the first intro lesson and social dance of the month (plus every Saturday night after that). Just $10 for the lesson and/or social dance ($5 for students). No experience or partner required. ‚Ä¢ 6:45 pm - Doors open ‚Ä¢ 7:00 pm - Intro lesson with Sam Jackson and Meaghan Efford * ‚Ä¢ 8:00 - 11:00 pm - Social dance with DJ Carolyn Gebbie *PLEASE NOTE that the weekly lessons will start PROMPTLY at 7pm.

Juno & Grammy Nominated vocalist, Adonis Puentes, will be joined by the Jazz Bohemians, featuring Brent Jarvis (piano), Ken Lister (bass), Nicholas Marquez (percussion) and Brooke Maxwell (Sax). Adonis Puentes opens up the marvelous world of Cuban music to his audience the second they hear his rich voice. When the other players kick in with their tight, multi-layered arrangements, it becomes clear that Adonis is a powerful bandleader. Fronting an acoustic band, Adonis' vocals are surrounded by piano, bass, strings, and percussion. Music reflects the present and Adonis Puentes is a Cuban Sonero for our times. Adonis thrives on the growth and acclaim for his original sonero sound. As he puts it, ""I feel like a messenger of my roots and tradition, blessed that with me I have taken my music and heritage to many different places in the world; from Cuba, to Canada, USA, Mexico, Europe and Asia. My mission is to make you dance and enjoy my melodies and rhythms.""

See less Music and audio Victoria, British Columbia Tickets Find Tickets Royal Athletic Park 1014 Caledonia Ave, Victoria Royal Athletic Park is a multi-purpose, fully lit stadium in Victoria, British Columbia. It is primarily used for baseball, soccer, softball and football, but also hosts special events, such as the annual Great Canadian Beer Festival and Rifflandia Music Festival. It is approximately a ten-minute walk from the city centre.HistoryIn 1907 the burgeoning summer athletic teams did not have enough facilities for senior teams with paid attendances. Baseball in particular was challenged to find available dates at Oak Bay Grounds to operate due to a preference for lacrosse.Subsequently, the supporters of Canada's national summer sport lacrosse, at a meeting chaired by BC Premier McBride formed the Royal Victoria Athletic Association on March 26, 1908, and a senior lacrosse team was founded to enable the best intermediate (Under 21) players to play in the British Columbia Amateur Lacrosse Association (BCALA) League. The Oak Bay Grounds were put under the management of the senior baseball team and then later the Rugby Football Club. The lacrosse group, later shortened to the Royal Athletic Association, issued shares at $25 each with deposits of 10% and biannual calls of 10% to raise $25,000 for improvements to the grounds. The lease was signed for 5 acres at the corner of Cook and Pembroke Streets for the grounds.Contracts had been let by May 12, 1908 and $4,000 from the share offering and gate receipts was spent by June on the construction of a perimeter fence, 2 ticket offices, an inner fence, grandstand, and carriage parking area. The inner fence enclosed the 500 ft x 285 ft (152m x 87m) playing field. The grandstand on the south side of the playing field was 150 ft long x 25 ft deep with 10 rows of seats for more than 1000 spectators. Beneath the grandstand were dressing rooms and concessions. The original layout of the field and grandstand was essentially the same as today's; however based on maps used in advertising the original field also included half of the city block to the west between Quadra and Vancouver Streets. The carriage parking was on the east side off Cook Street. Guests See All 54 Going 786 Interested Go with friends Mary K.
