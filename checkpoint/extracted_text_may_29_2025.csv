Whether you want to: • Learn something new in the lesson • Dance your heart out at the social • Or simply enjoy the music, connect with others, and soak in the atmosphere — You’re warmly welcomed. This is a beautiful, inclusive, and supportive community where new friendships are made and everyone belongs. Location: Songhees Plaza (near the Johnson Street Bridge) Schedule: • 3:45 PM – Doors Open (This is a controlled area under our permit) • 4:00 – 4:30 PM – Intro to Kizomba • 4:30 – 7:30 PM – Social Dancing Cover: • $5 for students (with valid ID) • $10 general admission • Cash only What to Bring: • Water bottle (we also have water available for purchase if you forget) • A hat or sun umbrella • Sunglasses and sunscreen • Comfortable shoes for dancing on cement This year, we’re excited to offer a 10 x 17.6 ft sun tent to provide shade and help keep you cool while you relax between dances.

Your support helps with essentials like permits, insurance, equipment, venue fees, and more (approx. $3500–$4000 annually). Thank you for your understanding and continued support. If you have grant writing experience or would like to volunteer, we’d love to hear from you! Note: Photos and videos may be taken during the event for social media and future promotions.

We’ll begin with a beginner-friendly lesson— no partner or experience needed. After the class, enjoy an open-air social featuring a dynamic blend of Salsa, Bachata, and Kizomba, with just a light touch of Merengue to round out the evening. Whether you want to: • Learn something new in the lesson • Dance your heart out at the social • Or simply enjoy the music, connect with others, and soak in the atmosphere — You’re warmly welcomed. This is a beautiful, inclusive, and supportive community where new friendships are made and everyone belongs. Location: Songhees Plaza (near the Johnson Street Bridge) Schedule: • 3:45 PM – Doors Open (This is a controlled area under our permit) • 4:00 – 4:30 PM – Intro to Salsa • 4:30 – 7:30 PM – Social Dancing Cover: • $5 for students (with valid ID) • $10 general admission • Cash only What to Bring: • Water bottle (we also have water available for purchase if you forget) • A hat or sun umbrella • Sunglasses and sunscreen • Comfortable shoes for dancing on cement This year, we’re excited to offer a 10 x 17.6 ft sun tent to provide shade and help keep you cool while you relax between dances. Why We Charge: We’re still in the process of applying for government funding and, unfortunately, didn’t raise enough through our indoor socials to fully cover summer costs. Your support helps with essentials like permits, insurance, equipment, venue fees, and more (approx. $3500–$4000 annually). Thank you for your understanding and continued support. If you have grant writing experience or would like to volunteer, we’d love to hear from you! Note: Photos and videos may be taken during the event for social media and future promotions.

Mondays – April 7th, 14th, 21st & 28th at 111 Superior Street Foundation Class (6:30–7:35 PM) Perfect for absolute beginners or dancers looking to strengthen their foundation! In this class, we’ll break down the essential steps, body movement, and partner connection in a fun environment. You’ll learn the basics with proper technique while also adding styling to make your dancing look and feel smooth on the dance floor. No experience or partner needed—just bring your curiosity and energy! Intermediate Class (7:35–8:40 PM) Ready to level up? This class is designed for dancers who already feel comfortable with the basics and want to challenge themselves. We’ll dive into more fun patterns while also exploring musicality—how to connect those movements to the music in a more expressive way. Get ready to build confidence, fluidity, and your own unique style!

Cha Cha Cha is a fun dance with a playful energy that uses a very similar step to Salsa and learning them together will help you understand and be better at both.

It was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of the City of Victoria. The Victoria Police Station, city hall and McPherson Playhouse are adjacent to the square. There is a fountain in the square.In the summer, the city hires musicians to perform every weekday, charging no admission fee. For the British Columbia Day holiday, Centennial Square is one of the venues for the Victoria Electronic Music Festival, where musicians and DJs play for free.In the winter, the Downtown Victoria Business Association has temporarily set up Christmas lights, a Ferris wheel, and an ice skating rink in the square.In 2011, Occupy Victoria protesters camped in the square until a court, at the behest of the city, ordered them to leave.

DETAILS: • Friday, June 20th, 2025 • Method Studio, 841 Fisgard St, Victoria, BC • 7:30-11 pm: social dancing with 100% west coast swing (sorry, no lesson!) • Admission: $10 • Water and AC on us (and maybe some bonus chocolate) • Please keep in mind that parking is limited at the venue GENERAL SOCIAL DANCE ETIQUETTE: • Consent is cool- don't be creepy. • Shake off any shyness and get out there! Ask people to dance regardless if you’re a lead or follow, dancing for 10 years or started yesterday- it's more fun that way! • No teaching or unsolicited feedback on the dance floor. Good vibes only! • If you would like to partake in a steal dance, try to remain with that group for the whole song. • Bring a water bottle! The studio is known to get warm with more bodies in the space so we want you to stay healthy and hydrated. • Personal hygiene is important! Consider bringing a towel and/or a spare shirt to change into if you sweat easily. Our studio has a bathroom and change rooms available for all to use. • We recommend wearing clothes that are easy to move in, especially pants given the nature of the dance. • Clean, comfortable shoes (ideally dance shoes) on the dance floor only!

Seminar series for Tango Dancers that want to transform their way of moving and connecting! We will travel through the Essentials of Tango in order to look for new answers and deeper understanding. What makes tango truly captivating? It’s the embrace, the connection, and the walk. These three fundamental elements are the heartbeat of tango, and mastering them is essential for creating an unforgettable dance experience. You will learn how to condition your body to move with control, fluidity, and elegance. You’ll discover how to find and perfect your axis, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability in every step. We will also explore dissociation, a technique that allows you to move the upper and lower body independently but associated. This workshop series will show you how to apply these principles in both the leader and follower roles, improving connection and response in every moment of the dance. We will apply all this to: The secrets to generating power for boleos effortlessly off and on axis special follower technique class Pro tips to dance with ease and confidence 90 min class - $30 All 3 classes - $80 To register email grazs@shaw.ca or pm me, or talk to me .

April went by so quickly, which means it must've been super fun, which it definitely was.  Everyone at BC Swing Dance Club Victoria is so pleased with the way the first month of social dances went, and we hope to generate the same amount of enthusiasm in May. Let's make this month just as much fun! Come join us on May 4th for the first intro lesson and social dance of the month (plus every Saturday night after that). Just $10 for the lesson and/or social dance ($5 for students). No experience or partner required. • 6:45 pm - Doors open • 7:00 pm - Intro lesson with Sam Jackson and Meaghan Efford * • 8:00 - 11:00 pm - Social dance with DJ Carolyn Gebbie *PLEASE NOTE that the weekly lessons will start PROMPTLY at 7pm.  It is disruptive to the flow of the lesson if participants arrive late. For anyone who's interested in building their West Coast Swing fundamentals quickly, note that May will be the last month we'll be offering weekly classes with both Sam and Meaghan. With summer approaching it's a great time to build, refresh or accelerate your skills in the dance, so please be sure to take advantage of this opportunity.

Juno & Grammy Nominated vocalist, Adonis Puentes, will be joined by the Jazz Bohemians, featuring Brent Jarvis (piano), Ken Lister (bass), Nicholas Marquez (percussion) and Brooke Maxwell (Sax). Adonis Puentes opens up the marvelous world of Cuban music to his audience the second they hear his rich voice. When the other players kick in with their tight, multi-layered arrangements, it becomes clear that Adonis is a powerful bandleader. Fronting an acoustic band, Adonis' vocals are surrounded by piano, bass, strings, and percussion. Music reflects the present and Adonis Puentes is a Cuban Sonero for our times. Adonis thrives on the growth and acclaim for his original sonero sound. As he puts it, ""I feel like a messenger of my roots and tradition, blessed that with me I have taken my music and heritage to many different places in the world; from Cuba, to Canada, USA, Mexico, Europe and Asia. My mission is to make you dance and enjoy my melodies and rhythms.""

It is primarily used for baseball, soccer, softball and football, but also hosts special events, such as the annual Great Canadian Beer Festival and Rifflandia Music Festival. It is approximately a ten-minute walk from the city centre.HistoryIn 1907 the burgeoning summer athletic teams did not have enough facilities for senior teams with paid attendances. Baseball in particular was challenged to find available dates at Oak Bay Grounds to operate due to a preference for lacrosse.Subsequently, the supporters of Canada's national summer sport lacrosse, at a meeting chaired by BC Premier McBride formed the Royal Victoria Athletic Association on March 26, 1908, and a senior lacrosse team was founded to enable the best intermediate (Under 21) players to play in the British Columbia Amateur Lacrosse Association (BCALA) League. The Oak Bay Grounds were put under the management of the senior baseball team and then later the Rugby Football Club. The lacrosse group, later shortened to the Royal Athletic Association, issued shares at $25 each with deposits of 10% and biannual calls of 10% to raise $25,000 for improvements to the grounds. The lease was signed for 5 acres at the corner of Cook and Pembroke Streets for the grounds.Contracts had been let by May 12, 1908 and $4,000 from the share offering and gate receipts was spent by June on the construction of a perimeter fence, 2 ticket offices, an inner fence, grandstand, and carriage parking area. The inner fence enclosed the 500 ft x 285 ft (152m x 87m) playing field. The grandstand on the south side of the playing field was 150 ft long x 25 ft deep with 10 rows of seats for more than 1000 spectators. Beneath the grandstand were dressing rooms and concessions. The original layout of the field and grandstand was essentially the same as today's; however based on maps used in advertising the original field also included half of the city block to the west between Quadra and Vancouver Streets. The carriage parking was on the east side off Cook Street. Guests See All 54 Going 786 Interested Go with friends Mary K.
