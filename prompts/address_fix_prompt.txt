You are an experienced information extractor. 
Your task is to carefully analyze a noisy, real-world event description and extract a complete, structured address for the venue where the event takes place.
The Input Data is below.

The description may include:
- The venue name (e.g., "Puerto Vallarta Amigos at Fisherman's Wharf")
- A street address (e.g., "1 Dallas Rd")
- Parenthetical notes, links, performer names, and unrelated text (IGNORE these)
- Links to social media or artist bios (IGNORE these)

You must identify and return the venue’s address in a structured JSON format.

Extract the following fields:
- address_id (always 0)
- full_address (always NULL)
- building_name (e.g., "Fisherman's Wharf" or "Puerto Vallarta Amigos")
- street_number (e.g., "1")
- street_name (e.g., "Dallas")
- street_type (e.g., "Road")
- direction (e.g., "East" or "West", if provided; otherwise null)
- city (use "Victoria" unless clearly another BC city is mentioned)
- met_area (always NULL)
- province_or_state (always "BC")
- postal_code (if present)
- country_id (always "CA")
- time_stamp (always NULL)

If it's on, there should be a post on https://www.facebook.com/pvamigos ..."
