Context:
I am building an application to save users time when searching for social dance and live music events. 
Extract relevant event details from the webpage's text (extracted_text) according to the instructions below.

2. Date Rules:
•	Use the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD and assume NO time zone.
•	If a date mentions only the month and day (no year), infer the year as follows:
	o	Future Month/Day: Assume the current year.
	o	Past Month/Day: Assume the next year.
•	"Today" should be interpreted as the current date.
•	If an event starts with a day_of_week (e.g. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) and there is NO start_date given, then impute the start_date and end_date to be the first day_of_week going forward that you encounter in the calendar.
	o	For example, this event "Thursday from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa " Would be interpreted as Thursday January 2, 2025 for the start_date and end_date, if your current date is December 28, 2024.
•	If an event starts with Tomorrow, For example, this event "Tomorrow from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa " Would be interpreted as Sunday December 29, 2025 for the start_date and end_date, when your current date is December 28, 2024.
_____________________________________
4. day_of_week and start_date Must Match
•	Double check and make sure that the day_of_week and the date are correct. 
•	If the start_date you compute can not possibly be the day_of_week then change the date to match that day_of_week as close as possible. 
•	For example, if the day_of_week is Wednesday and the start_date is 2025-05-29 then change the start_date to 2025-05-28.
•	Adjust the end_date if necessary based on this revised start_date.
_____________________________________
5. Recurring Events:
•	For recurring events (e.g., "every Saturday" or "1st and 3rd Tuesdays"), compute all occurrences within 12 months from today's date unless an end date is explicitly mentioned.
•	For example:
	o	The 1st Tuesday in 2025 is January 7, 2025.
	o	Saturdays in February 2025 are February 1, 8, 15, and 22.
________________________________________
6. Outdated Pages:
•	Events explicitly marked as "canceled" or "postponed" should have that wording put in their "description" field.
________________________________________
7. Additional Notes:
•	If there are events, only produce one JSON output. 
	o	Everything should be in that one response JSON string. 
	o	Do NOT create a separate JSON output for recurring JSON events. 
•	DO NOT return a list for a field. For example, if you found several "dance_style" (e.g. salsa, bachata, kizomba) put that in the "dance_style" field as "salsa, bachata, kizomba". Not as "[salsa, bachata, kizomba]"
•	If no events are found, respond with: "No events found."
