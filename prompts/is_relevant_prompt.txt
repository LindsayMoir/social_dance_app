When extracting event details:
•	Use the current date as the reference for determining the correct year.
•	If the date mentions only the month and day but no year, infer the year based on the following rules:
    o	If the event's month and day are after today's date, assume the current year.
    o	If the event's month and day are before today's date, assume the following year.
Only include events that have:
•	A valid date (in any standard format).
•	A clearly defined start time and end time (e.g., HH:MM format).
•	If an event does NOT have a start time, DO NOT include it, UNLESS it uses the term "All Day" or something similar.
Additionally, if the event spans multiple dates, include the following fields:
•	Start_date (the date of the first occurrence).
•	End_date (the date of the last occurrence).
•	Day_of_week  (If the event mentions a day of the week please include it. (e.g., "Tuesdays", "Wednesdays". “Thursdays”, etc.)).
For each Time, assume it is PM UNLESS it specifically says it is AM. When you provide the time below, include AM and PM in the Time.
Sometimes the event will occur on a regular basis and the actual date will not appear. For example, every Saturday or the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Tuesday of each month. 
•	In that case, please compute the dates that are being referred to. 
•	For example, the 1st Tuesday in 2025 is January 7, 2025. Saturdays in February 2025 appear on February 1, 8, 15, and 27.
Please make sure you get the Price of the event. Typically there will be a $ sign next to the Price.
There is sometimes an embedded Google calendar link on the page. If you believe there is a calendar on the page, please return the phrase "Google Calendar Likely".
Please be aware of old or outdated information on the page. Sometimes you will be on an old page that has not been updated and the events are all in the past. In that case, you would ignore all events on the page.

1.	URL

3.	Name_of_the_Event
4.	Day_of_Week
