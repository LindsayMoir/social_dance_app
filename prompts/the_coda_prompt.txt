Context:
You are building an application designed to save users time when searching for social dance and live music events. 
Your task is to carefully extract all relevant social dance event details from the provided text (extracted_text) according to the guidelines below.

extracted_text is provided at the end of these instructions.
________________________________________
Instructions for Extracting Event Information:

1. Source:
- The "source" is always "The Coda".

2. Location:
- The "location" is always "The Coda, 751 View Street, Victoria, BC, V8W 1J9, Canada".

3. URL:
- The "url" is always "https://gotothecoda.com/calendar".

4. Identifying Each Event:
- There are multiple events. Often over 20 events.
- Each event description begins explicitly with a day of the week (e.g., Sunday, Monday, Tuesday) followed by a comma and then a date (e.g., April 4).
- Each event ends immediately before the words "More Info".

5. Event Selection:
- Extract ALL events listed, regardless of whether the description explicitly mentions "dance" or not.

6. Fields to Extract (in JSON format):
For each event, you must include ALL the following fields, using '' for missing information:

[{
    "source": "The Coda",
    "dance_style": "<Select from: bachata, balboa, douceur, east coast swing, kizomba, lindy hop, merengue, salsa, semba, swing, tango, tarraxo, tarraxa, tarraxinha, urban kiz, west coast swing, wcs, or leave '' if not explicitly mentioned>",
    "url": "https://gotothecoda.com/calendar",
    "event_type": "<Select one: social dance, class, workshop, other, rehearsal, live music>",
    "event_name": "<Full event title from extracted_text>",
    "day_of_week": "<Day the event starts>",
    "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
    "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD or same as start_date if single-day>",
    "start_time": "<HH:MM in 24-hour>",
    "end_time": "<HH:MM in 24-hour or null if not provided>",
    "price": "<Include exact price format e.g. $15, $20>",
    "location": "The Coda, 751 View Street, Victoria, BC, V8W 1J9, Canada",
    "description": "<Brief summary including key details, dance genres, band names, and event highlights>"
},
... (continue for every event listed)]
There are MULTIPLE EVENTS. Often over 20 events. Please get ALL of the events.
Please make sure that you produce properly formatted JSON. Double check your work please.

7. Determining Dates:
- Use the current date as reference (format YYYY-MM-DD) and assume the time zone is PST.
- For dates without an explicit year, infer as follows:
  * Future Month/Day: Assume current year.
  * Past Month/Day LESS THAN 90 days ago: Assume current year.
  * Past Month/Day MORE THAN 90 days ago: Assume next year.
- "Today" means the current date.
- If no explicit date is given (only a day of the week), assign the next upcoming date corresponding to that day.

8. day_of_week and start_date Must Match
- Double check and make sure that the day_of_week and the date are correct. 
- If the start_date you compute can not possibly be the day_of_week then change the date to match that day_of_week as close as possible. 
- For example, if the day_of_week is Wednesday and the start_date is 2025-05-29 then change the start_date to 2025-05-28.
- Adjust the end_date if necessary based on this revised start_date.

8. Recurring Events:
- If an event explicitly mentions recurring frequencies (e.g., "every Saturday"), list all occurrences within the next 12 months.

9. Outdated or Canceled Events:
- If events are explicitly mentioned as canceled or postponed, clearly state that in the "description" field.

10. Additional Notes:
- Ensure you produce exactly one comprehensive JSON list containing all identified events.
- If no events match the criteria, respond explicitly: "No events found."
