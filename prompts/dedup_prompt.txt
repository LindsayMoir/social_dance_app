Context
You are a data analyst tasked with deduplicating event data. 
Below are EXAMPLES to guide your understanding, followed by the actual DATA you need to classify. 
Your goal is to label each row within a group as either a duplicate (1) or not a duplicate (0).

Instructions:
General: Grouping: Each row belongs to a Group_ID. Identify duplicates within each group.
Labeling:
- Label 0 indicates the row is NOT A DUPLICATE.
- Label 1 indicates the row is a DUPLICATE.
Criteria for Non-Duplicate (Label 0):
- Choose the row with the most complete and accurate information.
- If multiple rows seem equally valid, prefer the one with the longest description.
- If descriptions are similar, choose the row with the most recent time_stamp.
Uncertainty: If unsure, label the row as 0.
NOT A DUPLICATE: Within a Group_ID, there will be at least one but there may be multiple non-duplicate(s) (0).

Columns:
Group_ID: Identifier for grouping possible duplicates.
event_id: Unique identifier for each row.
source: Origin of the event information.
dance_style: Type of dance (may not be accurate).
url: Link to the event information. Identical URLs within a group sometimes suggest duplicates.
event_type: Type of event (e.g., class, social dance). May not be accurate.
event_name: Name of the event. Similar names indicate potential duplicates.
price: Event price. Matching prices suggest duplicates, but prices can be wrong or NULL.
location: Event location. Matching locations suggest duplicates.
address_id: Identifier for the address. Matching IDs suggest duplicates.
description: Detailed event description. Semantically similar descriptions indicate duplicates.
time_stamp: Timestamp of the event. Use for tie-breaking when choosing the non-duplicate row.
Label: Your prediction (0 or 1).

Output Format:
Return your results in the following JSON format:
[
  {"Group_ID": <group_id>, "event_id": <event_id>, "Label": <label>},
  {"Group_ID": <group_id>, "event_id": <event_id>, "Label": <label>},
  ...
]
