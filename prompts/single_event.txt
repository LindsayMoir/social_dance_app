Context:
I am building an application to save users time when searching for social dance or live music events. 
•	Extract relevant event details from the webpage's text (extracted_text) according to these instructions.
•	Only extract the FIRST event.
•	The extracted_text is at the bottom of this prompt under the heading "extracted_text".
________________________________________

1. Event Fields to Extract:
For this event, provide the following details in JSON format.
You MUST include all of these fields. If you do not have any information for one of the fields, put '' in the field.
[{
    "source": "<The original source of information for this event>",
    "dance_style": "<choose one or muptiple: bachata, balboa, douceur, east coast swing, kizomba, lindy hop, merengue, salsa, semba, swing, tango, tarraxo, tarraxa, tarraxinha, urban kiz, west coast swing, wcs>",
    "url": "<the URL or link>",
    "event_type": "<choose one: social dance, class, workshop, other, rehearsal, live music>",
    "event_name": "<event name or title>",
    "day_of_week": "<e.g., Monday, Tuesday>",
    "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
    "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD or same as Start_Date if single-day>",
    "start_time": "<HH:MM>",
    "end_time": "<HH:MM or null>",
    "price": "<e.g., $15>",
    "location": "<venue name and address>",
    "description": "<short summary of event details>"
}]

2. Date Rules:
•	Use the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD and assume PST as the time zone.
•	If a date mentions only the month and day (no year), infer the year as follows:
	o	Future Month/Day: Assume the current year.
	o	Past Month/Day: Assume the next year.
•	"Today" should be interpreted as the current date.
•	If an event starts with a day_of_week (e.g. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) and there is NO start_date given, then impute the start_date and end_date to be the first day_of_week going forward that you encounter in the calendar.
	o	For example, this event "Thursday from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa " would be interpreted as Thursday January 2, 2025 for the start_date and end_date, if your current date is December 28, 2024.
•	If an event starts with Tomorrow, this event "Tomorrow from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa " would be interpreted as Sunday December 29, 2024 for the start_date and end_date, when your current date is December 28, 2024.
•	If an event starts with Today, this event "Today at 21:00 Ritmo Latino Party" would be interpreted as Friday January 31, 2025 for the start-date and end_date, when your current date is Friday January 31, 2025.

3. Recurring Events:
•	Only the FIRST event in the recurring event series should be put into the JSON output.
*	The "description" should have the details about the recurring event.
________________________________________
4. Outdated Pages:
•	Events explicitly marked as "canceled" or "postponed" should have that wording put in their "description" field.
________________________________________
5. Additional Notes:
•	DO NOT return a list for a field. For example, if you found several "dance_style" (e.g. salsa, bachata, kizomba) put that in the "dance_style" field as "salsa, bachata, kizomba". Not as "[salsa, bachata, kizomba]"
•	If no events are found, respond with: "No events found."
