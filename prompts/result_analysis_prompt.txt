You are analyzing the results of a comprehensive chatbot testing suite for a social dance events chatbot.

The chatbot converts natural language questions into SQL queries for a PostgreSQL database of dance events.

TASK: Analyze the test results below and identify recurring patterns in failures and low scores.

TEST RESULTS DATA:
{test_results_summary}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify recurring issue patterns (e.g., "date filtering problems", "venue matching issues", "event type confusion")
2. For each pattern, note:
   - How many tests are affected
   - Which categories are impacted
   - The underlying root cause
   - Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Prioritize issues by impact (frequency × severity)
4. Recommend specific fixes for top issues
