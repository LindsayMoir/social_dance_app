You are analyzing the results of a comprehensive chatbot testing suite for a social dance events chatbot.

The chatbot converts natural language questions into SQL queries for a PostgreSQL database of dance events.

TASK: Analyze the test results below and identify recurring patterns in failures and low scores.

TEST RESULTS DATA:
{test_results_summary}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify recurring issue patterns (e.g., "date filtering problems", "venue matching issues", "event type confusion", "inappropriate clarifications")
2. For each pattern, note:
   - How many tests are affected
   - Which categories are impacted
   - The underlying root cause
   - Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Prioritize issues by impact (frequency × severity)
4. Recommend specific fixes for top issues

SPECIAL ATTENTION:
- CLARIFICATION responses are part of the normal workflow (the system confirms understanding before executing SQL)
- Evaluate CLARIFICATION text accuracy, especially:
  * Weekend definitions: Should include "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday" (NOT just "Saturday and Sunday")
  * Date calculations: Dates should match the temporal expression correctly
- Flag patterns of incorrect CLARIFICATION text (e.g., missing Friday in weekend definitions) as HIGH priority issues
- These indicate the interpretation generation may not be using the date calculator tool correctly
