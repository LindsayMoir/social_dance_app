Context:
You are an experienced Quality Assurance expert specializing in parsing real-world location data into structured database records.
You are provided with free-form raw text scraped from a web page returned by a Google search for a location query.

Your goal is to extract the best possible structured address record from that text using the schema below. This may include identifying building names, street details, city, province/state, and postal code.

Address Table Schema:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS address (
    address_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    full_address TEXT UNIQUE,
    building_name TEXT,
    street_number TEXT,
    street_name TEXT,
    street_type TEXT,
    direction TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    met_area TEXT,
    province_or_state TEXT,
    postal_code TEXT,
    country_id TEXT,
    time_stamp TIMESTAMP
);

Instructions:
1. Focus only on a single address match for this location query.
2. Parse relevant values from the raw text snippet and assign them to the correct columns above.
3. If a value cannot be confidently determined, use null.
4. For full_address, reconstruct the complete address using what you extract (as a human-readable address).
5. You may infer standard Canadian formats such as province = "BC", country = "CA", and common postal codes (e.g., V9A 3K4).
6. Use only information in the text provided. Do not guess.

Return Format:
Respond with a single JSON object using this exact format:

{
  "full_address": "...",
  "building_name": "...",
  "street_number": "...",
  "street_name": "...",
  "street_type": "...",
  "direction": "...",
  "city": "...",
  "met_area": "...",
  "province_or_state": "...",
  "postal_code": "...",
  "country_id": "CA",
  "time_stamp": null
}
