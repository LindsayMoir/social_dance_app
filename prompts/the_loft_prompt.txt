________________________________________
Instructions for Extracting Event Information:

1. Source:
- The "source" is always "The Loft".

2. Location:
- The "location" is always "The Loft, 10 Pandora Street, Victoria, BC, Canada".

3. URL:
- The "url" is always "https://loftpubvictoria.com/events/month/".

4. Event Information:
- Each event is accessed through the events calendar.
- Extract event details from the individual event pages scraped from the calendar.
- Include the specific event page URL in the "url" field for each event.

5. Event Selection:
- Extract ALL events listed that match the dance styles: swing, balboa, lindy hop, east coast swing, west coast swing, wcs.
- You may also extract other dance-related events if they are clearly dance or live music events.

6. Fields to Extract (in JSON format):
For each event, you must include ALL the following fields, using '' for missing information:

[{
    "source": "The Loft",
    "dance_style": "<Select from: bachata, balboa, douceur, east coast swing, kizomba, lindy hop, merengue, salsa, semba, swing, tango, tarraxo, tarraxa, tarraxinha, urban kiz, west coast swing, wcs, or leave '' if not explicitly mentioned>",
    "url": "<Specific event page URL from extracted_text>",
    "event_type": "<Select one: social dance, class, workshop, other, rehearsal, live music>",
    "event_name": "<Full event title from extracted_text>",
    "day_of_week": "<Day the event starts>",
    "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
    "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD or same as start_date if single-day>",
    "start_time": "<HH:MM in 24-hour format, or '' if not provided>",
    "end_time": "<HH:MM in 24-hour format or '' if not provided>",
    "price": "<Include exact price format e.g. $15, $20, or 'Free' or '' if not provided>",
    "location": "The Loft, 10 Pandora Street, Victoria, BC, Canada",
    "description": "<Brief summary including key details, dance genres, band names, and event highlights>"
},
... (continue for every event listed)]
There are MULTIPLE EVENTS. Please get ALL of the events that match the dance styles.
Please make sure that you produce properly formatted JSON. Double check your work please.

7. Determining Dates:
- Use the current date as reference (format YYYY-MM-DD) and assume the time zone is PST.
- For dates without an explicit year, infer as follows:
  * Future Month/Day: Assume current year.
  * Past Month/Day LESS THAN 90 days ago: Assume current year.
  * Past Month/Day MORE THAN 90 days ago: Assume next year.
- "Today" means the current date.
- If no explicit date is given (only a day of the week), assign the next upcoming date corresponding to that day.

8. day_of_week and start_date Consistency
- Do not change the given day_of_week.
- If your computed start_date is not that weekday, shift the date by Â±1 day (whichever is closer) until it matches.
- Adjust end_date accordingly (if single-day, set equal to start_date).

9. Recurring Events:
- If an event explicitly mentions recurring frequencies (e.g., "every Saturday"), list all occurrences within the next 12 months.

10. Outdated or Canceled Events:
- If events are explicitly mentioned as canceled or postponed, clearly state that in the "description" field.

11. Additional Notes:
- Ensure you produce exactly one comprehensive JSON list containing all identified events.
- If no events match the criteria, respond explicitly: "No events found."
- Focus on swing dance styles (swing, lindy hop, east coast swing, west coast swing, balboa) which are The Loft's specialty.
