Context:
You are an expert JSON extractor.
I am building an application to save users time when searching for social dance and live music events.
Extract relevant event details from the webpage's text (extracted_text) according to the instructions below.
The extracted_text is at the bottom of these instructions under the heading extracted_text.
Follow these steps exactly:
________________________________________
1. Extract
From the extracted_text below, find every event and build a JSON **array** where each element has exactly these keys:
source, dance_style, url, event_type, event_name, day_of_week, start_date, end_date, start_time, end_time, price, location, description
You MUST include all of these fields. If you do not have any information for one of the fields, put '' in the field.
For the url field: If you are extracting from a calendar/listing page with individual event links, use the specific event page URL. Otherwise, use '' if no specific URL is available.
________________________________________
2. Date Rules:
•	Use the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD and assume this is the PST time zone.
•	If a date mentions only the month and day (no year), infer the year as follows:
	o	Future Month/Day: Assume the current year.
	o	Past Month/Day LESS THAN 90 days ago: Assume the current year.
	o	Past Month/Day MORE THAN 90 days ago: Assume the next year.
•	"Today" should be interpreted as the current date.
•	If an event starts with a day_of_week (e.g. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) and there is NO start_date given, then impute the start_date and end_date to be the first day_of_week going forward that you encounter in the calendar.
	o	For example, this event "Thursday from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa " Would be interpreted as Thursday January 2, 2025 for the start_date and end_date, if your current date is December 28, 2024.
•	If an event starts with Tomorrow, for example, this event "Tomorrow from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa" would be interpreted as Sunday December 29, 2024 for the start_date and end_date, when your current date is December 28, 2024.
_____________________________________
3. day_of_week and start_date Consistency
•	Do not change the given day_of_week.
•	If your computed start_date is not that weekday, shift the date by ±1 day (whichever is closer) until it matches.
•	Adjust end_date accordingly (if single-day, set equal to start_date).
_____________________________________
4. Recurring Events:
•	For recurring events (e.g., "every Saturday" or "1st and 3rd Tuesdays"), compute all occurrences within 12 months from today's date unless an end date is explicitly mentioned.
•	For example:
	o	The 1st Tuesday in 2025 is January 7, 2025.
	o	Saturdays in February 2025 are February 1, 8, 15, and 22.
________________________________________
5. Outdated Pages:
•	Events explicitly marked as "canceled" or "postponed" should have that wording put in their "description" field.
________________________________________
6. Additional Notes:
•	If there are events, only produce one JSON output. 
	o	Everything should be in that one response JSON string. 
	o	Do NOT create a separate JSON output for recurring JSON events. 
•	DO NOT return a list for a field. For example, if you found several "dance_style" (e.g. salsa, bachata, kizomba) put that in the "dance_style" field as "salsa, bachata, kizomba". Not as "[salsa, bachata, kizomba]"
•	If an event has NO start_date (specific date or inferred day_of_week), do NOT include it - this is an invalid event. Events without times are acceptable as long as they have a date.
________________________________________
7. Validate  
Once you’ve built the JSON array, immediately parse it in your own “mind” (i.e. treat it as if you ran it through a JSON parser).  
• 	**If it fails** (missing comma, unquoted string, trailing comma, wrong brackets…), **fix it**.  
•	**Keep repeating** this “generate → parse → fix” loop until it is **valid JSON**.  
________________________________________
8. Output  
•	 Only output the final JSON.  
•	 Do **not** wrap it in markdown or add any comments.  

9. Example
