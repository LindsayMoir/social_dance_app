Context:
I am building an application to save users time when searching for social dance and live music events. 
Extract relevant event details from the webpage's text (extracted_text) according to the instructions below. 
The extracted_text is at the bottom of these instructions under the heading extracted_text
________________________________________
1. Event Fields to Extract:
For each identified event, provide the following details in JSON format.
You MUST include all of these fields. If you do not have any information for one of the fields, put '' in the field. Always fill the url field as ''.

    "dance_style": "<choose one or muptiple: bachata, balboa, douceur, east coast swing, kizomba, lindy hop, merengue, salsa, semba, swing, tango, tarraxo, tarraxa, tarraxinha, urban kiz, west coast swing, wcs>",

2. Date Rules:
•	Use the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD and assume NO time zone.
•	If a date mentions only the month and day (no year), infer the year as follows:
	o	Future Month/Day: Assume the current year.
	o	Past Month/Day LESS THAN 90 days ago: Assume the current year.
	o	Past Month/Day MORE THAN 90 days ago: Assume the next year.
•	"Today" should be interpreted as the current date.
•	If an event starts with a day_of_week (e.g. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) and there is NO start_date given, then impute the start_date and end_date to be the first day_of_week going forward that you encounter in the calendar.
	o	For example, this event "Thursday from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa " Would be interpreted as Thursday January 2, 2025 for the start_date and end_date, if your current date is December 28, 2024.
•	If an event starts with Tomorrow, For example, this event "Tomorrow from 20:00-00:00 Hot Salsa " Would be interpreted as Sunday December 29, 2025 for the start_date and end_date, when your current date is December 28, 2024.
_____________________________________
3. Recurring Events:
•	For recurring events (e.g., "every Saturday" or "1st and 3rd Tuesdays"), compute all occurrences within 12 months from today's date unless an end date is explicitly mentioned.
•	For example:
	o	The 1st Tuesday in 2025 is January 7, 2025.
	o	Saturdays in February 2025 are February 1, 8, 15, and 22.
________________________________________
4. Outdated Pages:
•	Events explicitly marked as "canceled" or "postponed" should have that wording put in their "description" field.
________________________________________
5. Additional Notes:
•	If there are events, only produce one JSON output. 
	o	Everything should be in that one response JSON string. 
	o	Do NOT create a separate JSON output for recurring JSON events. 
•	DO NOT return a list for a field. For example, if you found several "dance_style" (e.g. salsa, bachata, kizomba) put that in the "dance_style" field as "salsa, bachata, kizomba". Not as "[salsa, bachata, kizomba]"
•	If an event has no specific dates or times mentioned, this is an invalid event. DO NOT create a JSON output for this event.
•	If no events are found, respond with: "No events found."
