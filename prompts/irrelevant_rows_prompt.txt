## Context:
You are a data analyst responsible for removing **irrelevant** data from a database of social dance and live music events. 
Your goals are:
1. To classify each row as either **relevant (0)** or **irrelevant (1)**.
2. To determine a new event type for each row based on its content.

You have these columns in the Data below.
- **event_id**
- **event_name**
- **dance_style**
- **description**
- **day_of_week**
- **start_date**
- **end_date**
- **start_time**
- **end_time**
- **source**
- **location**
- **price**
- **url**
- **event_type** (existing column that may or may not be accurate)
- **address_id**
- **time_stamp**

All of these columns may contain relevant information. In particular:
- **event_name** and **description** often have the most direct clues about whether the event is a dance event, live music, what type it is, etc.
- **location** can also provide clues (e.g., "Dance Victoria" in the address usually indicates a dance-related event).

---

### What is Relevant Data?
An event (row) is **relevant (0)** if:
- The row contains information about dancing, live music, or dance-related activities, and/or
- The **dance_style** likely includes one or more of these dance styles:
  - '2-step', 'bachata', 'balboa', 'cha cha', 'cha cha cha', 'country waltz', 'double shuffle', 'douceur',
    'east coast swing', 'foxtrot', 'kizomba', 'lindy hop', 'line dance', 'merengue', 'milonga', 'night club',
    'nite club', 'nite club 2', 'nite club two', 'quickstep', 'rhumba', 'rumba', 'salsa', 'samba', 'semba',
    'swing', 'tango', 'tarraxa', 'tarraxinha', 'tarraxo', 'two step', 'urban kiz', 'waltz', 'wcs', 'west coast swing', 'zouk'.

### What is Irrelevant Data?
A row is **irrelevant (1)** if:
- The event is not about **social dancing, dance classes, live music, or dance-related activities**.
- The event is **not a dance or live music event** (e.g., "Bike Repair Class", "Cemetery Tour").

### Special Cases:
- If **source** equals "Bard and Banker", "The Loft", "Deb Rhymer Band", or "The Coda", always label the event as **relevant (0)**.
- If **dance_style** contains any of the listed relevant dance styles, label the event as **relevant (0)**.
- If the **event_name** includes "Miguelito", the row is **relevant (0)** (a special rule). 
- If **location** includes "Dance Victoria", that also strongly indicates a dance event (relevant (0)).

Please rely mostly on event_name (first) and then description (second) to classify as relevant (0) or irrelevant (1).
The other columns may be helpful.
Only mark a row (event) as irrelevant(1) if you are certain it is irrelevant (1). The Label column should only have 0 or 1 in it.
---

### Additional Classification for Event Type
In addition to labeling each row as relevant (0) or irrelevant (1), analyze **all columns**—especially **event_name**, **description**, and **location**—to determine the event type. 
Classify the event into one or more of the following:
- **class** (if the event appears to be a dance lesson or class),
- **social dance** (if the event is a social dance gathering),
- **rehearsal** (if the event is for a special group only for purposes of practising and then performing later on),
- **workshop** (if the event is a workshop),
- **live music"" (if the event has a live band)
- **other** (if it doesn't clearly fall into one of the above categories). 

If an event fits multiple categories (e.g., a class that is also a social dance), list all applicable types separated by commas.
Check each listed dance_style (above) to see if it matches any relevant dance style.
In cases of contradiction, prefer the direct dance references in event_name/description over the dance_style field.
If the **event_name** includes "Miguelito", the dance_style is "bachata, cha cha, cumbia, salsa".

### Output Format
Because the existing data already has an event_type column, you should return your new classification in a separate field named event_type_new. You must also include the event_id and the Label (0 or 1) for each row.
Return your results in the following **valid JSON** format:

json
[
  {"event_id": <event_id>, "Label": <label>, "event_type_new": "<event_type_new>"},
  {"event_id": <event_id>, "Label": <label>, "event_type_new": "<event_type_new>"},
  {"event_id": <event_id>, "Label": <label>, "event_type_new": "<event_type_new>"}
  ...
]
Where:
event_id is the row’s unique ID.
Label is 0 for relevant, 1 for irrelevant.
event_type_new is a string (e.g., "class", "social dance", "workshop", "other", "rehearsal", or a combination like "class, social dance").
