Today's date is: 2025-02-09. Use this for all date calculations.
Context:
I am building an application to save users time when searching for social dance events.

Extract relevant event details from the extracted_text below. Note that while the extracted_text does not include today's date, you must use the provided current date (2025-02-09) when interpreting and calculating event dates.

Event Fields (JSON Format):
[
    {
        "source": "<The original source of information for this event>",
        "dance_style": "<choose one or multiple from: bachata, balboa, douceur, east coast swing, kizomba, lindy hop, merengue, salsa, semba, swing, tango, tarraxo, tarraxa, tarraxinha, urban kiz, west coast swing, wcs>",
        "url": "''",
        "event_type": "<choose one: social dance, class, workshop, other>",
        "event_name": "<event name or title>",
        "day_of_week": "<e.g., Monday, Tuesday>",
        "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
        "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD (or same as start_date if single-day)>",
        "start_time": "<HH:MM>",
        "end_time": "<HH:MM or null>",
        "price": "<e.g., $15>",
        "location": "<venue name and address>",
        "description": "<short summary of event details>"
    }
]

Date Rules:
- For any event date provided with only a month and day (e.g., "Feb 7th"), determine the year using the current date (2025-02-09):
   - If the month/day is later than the current date (e.g., "Feb 10"), assume the current year.
   - If the month/day is earlier than the current date, assume the next year.
- Interpret the words "Today" and "Tomorrow" as 2025-02-09 and 2025-02-10, respectively.
- If an event only lists a weekday (e.g., "Thursday from 20:00-00:00") without a specific date, set the start_date to the next occurrence of that weekday after 2025-02-09.
- IMPORTANT: **If an event specifies new start and end dates with a range (e.g., "New Start & End Dates: ..., Feb 10-Mar 3"), then:**
   - Parse the part before the dash as the start date and the part after the dash as the end date.
   - Use the current date (2025-02-09) to decide the year: for example, "Feb 10" should be interpreted as "2025-02-10" (since February 10 is after February 09) and "Mar 3" as "2025-03-03".
   - When a "New Start & End Dates:" header is present, ignore any previous dates mentioned and use the new date range.
- For recurring events (e.g., "Every Saturday"), list all occurrences within the next 6 months, but do not include dates that fall before the current date.

Output a single JSON array containing all extracted events that conform to the above format and date rules.
