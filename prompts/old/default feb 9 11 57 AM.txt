Context:
I am building an application to save users time when searching for social dance events.

Extract relevant event details from the extracted_text below. **The extracted_text does not contain today's date, but you must use the current date when interpreting event dates.**

Event Fields (JSON Format):
[
    {
        "source": "<The original source>",
        "dance_style": "<e.g., salsa, bachata>",
        "url": "''",
        "event_type": "<social dance, class, workshop, other>",
        "event_name": "<Event name>",
        "day_of_week": "<Monday, Tuesday, etc.>",
        "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
        "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD or same as start_date>",
        "start_time": "<HH:MM>",
        "end_time": "<HH:MM or null>",
        "price": "<$15>",
        "location": "<venue & address>",
        "description": "<short summary>"
    }
]

Date Rules:
- If a date has **only month and day** (e.g., "April 15"), assume:
  - **Future date → same year.**
  - **Past date → next year.**
- "Today" → **Use YYYY-MM-DD**.
- "Tomorrow" → **Use YYYY-MM-DD +1 day**.
- If an event has **only a weekday (e.g., 'Thursday from 20:00-00:00')**, find the next occurrence of that weekday.
- Recurring events ("Every Saturday") → **List all dates for the next 6 months, BUT 
  - If a recurring event starts before the current date, DO NOT include the past events.**
