cleanup_stale_instagram_urls.py

Utility script to delete stale Instagram and fbcdn URLs from the database.

Instagram CDN URLs (fbcdn.net) contain time-limited access tokens that expire after 24-48 hours.
This script removes old URLs that are no longer accessible to prevent wasted processing time.

Usage:
    python utilities/cleanup_stale_instagram_urls.py [--days N] [--dry-run]

Options:
    --days N    Delete URLs older than N days (default: 2)
    --dry-run   Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
