I am blown away by the generosity and kindness of people!  The Go Fund Me for Dean is now fully funded!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

Dean had his last chemo this past Friday!  7 out of 7 DONE . Thank goodness as every chemo really made him feel even more horrible than usual for a day or so after. 

And as of today only 4 more radiation sessions… out of 35 total…. So 31 done. 

This past week or so has been particularly tough with Dean’s neck breaking out in to a raw wound and his mouth, throat and tongue sores again being very inflamed and sore making it difficult to eat and talk… and sleep etc. plus his throat is raw. But eventhough it is very painful he has been forcing himself to drink some calories each day but despite his determination he has lost some weight. 

He’s a little better and brighter this week … especially with his neck wound healing and the chemo effects wearing off. But still it’s tough. 

And apparently, even after his last treatment which will be Monday, there are still a few more weeks were the treatments are still working and so the side effects will continue. 

But then the healing can begin and Dean is looking forward to getting back to his healthy eating and supplements and exercise and better sleep. 

Who knows how long it will take before he can work again as it will take time to build up his strength, which he needs to paint and do handyman chores, and let his mouth and throat heal to regain his ability to talk loudly in order to teach dance or DJ. 

Right now he’s basically not talking at all as it hurts to open his mouth and use his voice. And for those of you that know Dean well, not talking is especially difficult!  

Then 3 months from after last treatment they will check and I believe with all my heart that they will find Dean cancer free! s o d e t o p n S r t 8 c 3 e 1 g r L 9 2 c 6 a f e m 3 o r 3 0 h 0 n 1 1 M g l g c l 8 5 9 0 m g 8 6 7 0 4 6 2 h 1 f Darlene Pinch s o d e t o p n S r t 8 2 3 J 1 g a 9 2 c 6 a f 1 m 3 t 2 3 h 0 r 1 y 1 n l g c l 6 5 9 0 1 a 8 : 7 0 2 6 2 u 1 f · Shared with Public OH MY GOSH!!

Andre and I are teaching a WCS series starting THIS Wednesday, January 8, 2025 - Advanced Beginner / Intermediate. 

This is to keep Dean & Vanessa’s classes going while Dean is going through cancer treatments and Vanessa is away. Come on out and join us!!

It will be a four week series.
January 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th. 

$75 for the 4 weeks. 

Location:
Centennial United Church, 612 David St. 

Lesson and practice time is 7-9:30pm 

(this was posted some places incorrectly previously as 7:30-9:00 but PLEASE NOTE The correct time is 7:00-9:30)

This series will focus on reinforcing and updating the basics… exploring how to 'play' with the basics to enhance your dancing and dance experience. 

Please register IN ADVANCE with Andre by email: wcsdray@gmail.com and then you may pay in cash at the door or in advance by etransfer to Andre. n r S o t s d o e p l i 0 i 9 u 5 c 1 a n o r 2 g 7 m h 5 2 1 l g l f e f h 3 a h m 2 1 7 9 m 5 M L r 0 u 8 e 7 l 0 t Darlene Pinch n r S o t s d o e p a i 0 2 9 u r c 1 a a : 0 2 g 7 m h 5 2 1 l g 5 f 8 f h 3 y h m 2 7 9 m J 2 n a u t u 7 l 0 t · Shared with Public Hey to all my WCS friends!!!
