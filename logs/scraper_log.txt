### Explanation:
1. **Dance Style**: The text mentions Salsa, Bachata, and Kizomba classes.
2. **Event Type**: The events are classes.
3. **Event Name**: The event name is inferred from the context as "Salsa & Bachata Classes."
4. **Day of Week**: The classes run on Monday or Tuesday evenings.
5. **Start Date**: The next Monday from the current date (2025-02-27) is March 3, 2025.
6. **End Date**: Same as the start date since it's a recurring event without an end date mentioned.
7. **Start Time**: Evening classes typically start around 19:00, though the exact time is not specified.
8. **End Time**: Not specified, so it's null.
9. **Price**: Not specified.
10. **Location**: Not specified.
11. **Description**: Summarizes the key details about the classes.

Since the classes are recurring and happen every Monday and Tuesday, the JSON includes the next occurrence based on the current date.

Since the text mentions weekly classes without specifying the exact days or times, I've set the start and end dates to the day following the current date (2025-02-27). The day_of_week field is set to all days of the week to indicate that classes occur weekly.
